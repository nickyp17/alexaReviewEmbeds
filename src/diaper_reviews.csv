    We have purchased pampers cruisers for three years now and have loved them. We have never had a blow out, but now they changed the band and they fit bigger and our kid had a blowout because they are loose fitting around the legs and the chemical smell is horrible. We have always bought pampers so this change was very disappointing.

    I love this diapers. I think they are the best diaper from pampers by far. I just feel like they are so small for being size 7. Barely a difference between size 6.

    We're using these for our toddler since a long time. Overall, we are very satisfied with the product. It fits the contours well and generally, it is hard for anything to leak but in some rare extreme cases, sometimes, a leak is not prevented. but this wouldn't stop us from continuing using this product, which makes lives of parents easier.

    Love these. Absorbent and way more comfortable for my kid than regular diapers. They fit his chunky little waist pretty nicely. It is game changing to have the little tape piece on the back in order to wrap up a poopy diaper! Amazing.

    I saw commercials for this but found it was hard to find in Canada, saw it was available and wanted to compare it to the pampers easy ups I‚Äôve been using. Love the elastic at the waist very stretchy however if using this as a diaper along with potty training you lose in absorbency.

    These are nice and soft with great absorbency. My son sleeps all night with no leaks. They move with him, which is important for a busy toddler. They are easy up and down which will also be great when we start potty training. The ONLY downside is I find them slightly narrow in the bum.

    Great soft pull up pampers - much better design than the huggies pull ups. However the pull ups are  DRENCHED in talcum powder ODOUR/SMELL. The box doesn't say that it is scented so I assumed it was unscented and was shocked at the very heavy smell of talcum powder. I wonder why the company uses this odour for their diapers - I sure hope that they are not using actual talcum powder in their diapers as it well known that talcum powder is considered unsafe to use on babies.

    Like : excellent for quick diaper changesDislike :  diaper sits too low in the waist, and the ‚Äúcompartment‚Äù small. Meaning it could get messy when poop rides along the back of your toddler. My toddler is 2 yrs old and 25lbs.

    With a wiggly toddler it is a perfect diaper to be able to put on. These days the kiddo also tries to put this on own. Cute colours and great stretch! I switch between these and normal diapers based on the timing. Mostly use these during the day as night efficiency might be doubtful

    I never write reviews but because Im mom now I will share my experience to help another parent. The only pro about these diapers is that it‚Äôs easy to put on your baby when he/she is moving around while changing. My son is 8 months I bought him size 4 they just fit. They don‚Äôt last through the night, once the diaper is full it leaked all up his back and in his crib. 2 hours after I put him to bed I had to change him so they definitely don‚Äôt last 12 hours. If you want to use these diapers purchase night time diapers with it because these are just day time diapers that have to be changed every hour or they start to look huge

    My great granddaughter is 3 and is slowly leaving diapers days behind.  However, we still do not want her to have accidents at play school or anytime we are out, therefore these diapers.  She is chunky and the size 7 fit absolutely  perfect and are very comfortable.  I actually ordered another box and it arrived today, so she will be set until she is finally trained,  I hope.

    If your kid has thighs or a booty, do not buy these. These are for skinny children. You with the big booty baby, just click off and don't buy them. The only way I can get these on my son who normally wears size 4 regular pampers is to rip the sides so that there's only about 1 inch left connected at the top. It ends up looking like he has a baby thong on because it keeps wedging in his bum because the sides aren't holding it out. The sides do not stretch enough and they bottom part is cut too low to fit his thighs through the holes. If your child has skinny legs and minimal bum, these probably would work for you.

    My daughter is 9 months old and she always wants to walk on all fours, so when I change her diaper, she tries to roll over. These diapers have been great because they‚Äôre faster to put on her and I can do it even if she‚Äôs upside down and trying to escape, haha. Also, they‚Äôre great for the night. They keep her dry and they look more comfy than the usual diapers with the straps.

    I‚Äôm not sure if I got a bad batch as this was the first time buying these diapers but I hate them! So for starters they pull up like pull ups, the plastic tab thing they put on he back I found useless but my main problem with these diapers is they leak horribly. My son has always used pampers baby dry which we love how ever he our grew the size 6 and he has autism so isn‚Äôt ready for potty training yet every single diaper leaked. They don‚Äôt absorb very well they are no good for over night and once they get wet they have this horrid smell that you can smell threw my sons clothes. They do have the wetness line which I do like how ever I will not be purchasing these ever again. Do not recommend

    We mainly bought this diaper because it is lightweight and so our son can get use to wearing pull ups. also most times, the stores don't have the size 7 and so i always stock up on here. We noticed with previous diapers in this brand,  it was leaving indentation marks on the hips. With this one, it is soft and stretchy and so it adjust to his waist and doesn't fall off. There is no risk of us tying it too tight or loose.But one thing i would say is be careful because if you have to fight your child to put his diapers on, the sides might just tear and then there is no way to fix that up. You may have to use a strong tape but then it wont be as elastic as it usually is.

    Good price point. It is scented but I leave it out and the scent either disappeared a bit or I just got use to it. Scent don‚Äôt bother us. The diapers do leave a red mark around the thigh that the other pampers pull ups don‚Äôt. I will try to size up and see if this continues. My baby is 20-22 lbs (her weight fluctuates) wearing a size 3.

    They fit my 18lb baby so well! He is such a squirmer, and getting a diaper on him is an impossible task. These ones are so much easier to put on! The waistband is so nice and fits great. And it looks 10x more comfortable than regular diaper waistbands with the straps. The only thing I don't love it how scented they are. I could smell them before I even opened the plastic sleeve. But I love everything else about this diaper, that I'll deal with the strong scent.If you have a baby that doesn't sit still, these are a must!

    If your toddler is the type who will not stay still for diaper changes this is for you. We have also tried the Huggies brand but we like this better. As other have said it is a bit narrower so you'll have to check for wedgies and make sure it's centered when put on.We used these on an overseas flight and had no problems getting our 2 year old changed standing in the on board washroom.

    They are great for potty training and I haven't had any leaks at all. I do like that they are easy to pull up and down but it makes it really hard to clean up after a bowel movement or to put zincofax on when there are no tabs to open and close. I have to rip the sides to clean, then there's no way to wrap it up neatly because the sticky tabs are gone. I also have to put it on, pull it to the side and then apply the zincofax which causes a huge mess. Decent amount of stretch to them though, you have to pull pretty hard to actually rip them

    I‚Äôve been using these for 6 months to almost a year. Once my son hit the age where he refused to lie down to be changed these were super handy. I could change him while he stood up or even sat on my lap (as long as it was just a pee). He learned to step into them and they are one of the only brands that don‚Äôt irritate his sensitive skin. Highly recommend these. I stopped struggling with diaper changes thanks to this pull up style.

    I want to start by saying, we love the ease of these diapers. The pull up style with easy rip sides are a dream for changing young toddlers. In the most polite way I can say about a baby; if your babies tush is more voluptuous maybe try something else. We found our baby got wedgies often and it was hard to keep the diaper down. The rest of the fit was perfect, just made for narrow bums. We call these diapers cheeky cut diapers. As far as everything else, if you know pampers you know these. They are the same, just different fit.

    Our baby is extremely fussy when it comes to diaper changes and extremely mobile. This kid screams and rolls as soon as she hits the change pad, so we decided to try these diapers. Huge improvement! Obviously still not a fan of diaper changes, but for wet diapers we can use these for standing/walking/crawling/squirming changes with a lot more ease!  For poopy diapers we still have to lay her down to clean her up, but at least there's some relief. It's difficult to find other pull up style diapers in a size 3 so this has been a reliable choice. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the scent - is that really necessary?

    This is convenient for squirmy babies/toddlers. It‚Äôs also super absorbent and doesn‚Äôt leak. The downside is the scent. It‚Äôs so overly scented that it almost smells unnatural to be touching the skin. I left one diaper on my baby‚Äôs dresser for an hour and her whole room smelled like a baby powder bomb exploded in there. It‚Äôs like a whole bottle of baby powder was put into each diaper. With all the commercials we see about baby powder causing health issues and skin cancer, it makes me weary about continuing to use them. I will definitely be returning them.

    I bought these because Huggies Lil‚Äô Movers Pull-on was out of stock everywhere (again...). My little guy likes these better. They are almost as absorbent as the Huggies (I did a commercial style comparison test), but much more absorbent than easy-ups training pants. At first I didn‚Äôt like the tear apart sides, which are like the easy-ups but they seem to be less irritating to my son and so it‚Äôs less of a fight to get these on him. They are easy to get on and off for using the potty and fit nicely around the legs and waist, very stretchy. I ended up finding some more Huggies and stocking up, but once they‚Äôre gone I‚Äôm going back to these. The only minus is that my daycare prefers the Huggies because they have adjustable tabs and can be put on and off without removing his pants entirely.

    *UPDATE: Sized down to a 6, they fit much better. Surprisingly, the narrow-ness of the diaper hasn't been an issue. No leaks so far, not even at night. They are now the preferred diapers. * I like the idea of these diapers-some independence for the little with the ""I can do it myself!"" mentality but with the ease of a diaper. Pull on, tear the sides to take off, use the tape to ""wrap it up"". And that side of things mostly works. However.... they seem to be a small make compared to the cruisers. We use a size 6 cruisers, I bought the size 7 in 360s and they are still smaller than then size 6 cruisers we usually buy. I also find them much narrower in the butt (think, sumo baby) and my kiddo is super slim. I had concerns about leaks and we are barely into the first sleeve so that's tbd. So far I know I won't be buying again, but right now it's mainly because there's no larger size.

    I have 2 kids the potty training 3YO and the now 1year only who won‚Äôt sit still. I like these diapers for overnights for my daughter they hold ALOT. Like no more wet bed in the morning from over spill/over full diaper. They hold way more than a pull-up. For my son the ‚Äúyou can change me if you catch me‚Äù they have been a god send because they are quick on, quick off. They also sit higher on his waist than a normal diaper so no more over the rim shots. The only downside is when we are out travelling you have to take off shoes pants then diaper instead of just pulling down the pants. At home (no shoes) we only use these diapers for how fast they are; for outings I do have the tab style in my diaper bag because getting shoes back on a squirming baby is not my style of fun..

    I saw these come on to the market, and being the pioneers we are, we decided to try them. First off, these diapers are your standard cruisers that we all know, love and trust‚Ä¶ but with one little quirk. No tape! And while I can see the appeal to quickly slide busy body toddlers and newly mobile infants into diapers, there are a few drawbacks to this type of diaper that makes it less desirable in some instances.- Pros -* Easy to slide onto busy body babies, no taping required.* Same absorbency and reliability of standard Pampers cruisers.- Cons -* Not easy to apply butt paste with diapers already on.* Must remove pants/shoes to put diapers on.* No tape to wrap up diaper securely, especially after a [wet] poop.- Conclusion -The thing that should make this diapers great and easy to use is also it‚Äôs Achilles heal. Since there‚Äôs no tape there‚Äôs no easy way to secure this diaper after a change, especially a wet poop‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs messy! And also because it‚Äôs a pull up style diaper you cannot change these diapers on the go when your LOs are wearing shoes and pants. Everything comes off, so road trips, mall days or just being out, is not a treat to change em. Another challenge I have is putting on butt paste, it‚Äôs quite a hassle! you either have to stick your hand into the diaper to apply the paste after it‚Äôs on or put the paste on the baby then try sliding them into the diaper without making a mess especially on the waistband and eventually on the clothes.- Recommendation -I wouldn‚Äôt rush to buy pull up style until my kid is closer to potty training and if he no longer needs butt paste or had fairly solid poops. Until then I‚Äôll switch back to regular good old tape style diapers. They may be a little more tedious to put on. But they do have their benefits.

    The idea of the pull up is great, but for some reason the materials used are much more irritating. My son uses a size 6 cruiser at night that he is slowly growing out of. Purchased the new pull up size 7 pair and he was so uncomfortable (itchy) that he couldn't wear it to bed. The original cruiser is much softer on the inside compared to the new pull up ones.

    I used the size 3 for my 10 month baby, he developed severe rashes after just a few days of use. I have been using swaddlers since his birth, never had any issue. We switched to this because of the ease of putting it on and taking it off. Just after a few days of using this, my baby started becoming very fussy at the time of diaper change. Then he was very itchy near his genitals. We went to the dr. who diagnosed it as a severe rash. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to another parent ever.

    We usually use Huggies little movers but decided to try these because of the pull up design. My issue with them is that they get quite full and heavy after a couple pees.

I think they are better than the pull ups but wouldn't use them in place of normal diaper.

    These diapers are so great for those kids who never stop moving because they have a 360¬∞ stretchy waistband that flexes with your kids movements. My son is constantly climbing and what we were using wasn't working anymore. I am so glad to have found these, they are super soft and he seems to be very comfortable in them. You can also say goodbye to blow outs with these diapers that are a pull-up style for easy and quick changes. They have a tape tab on the back so you can easily wrap up the diaper to throw out. I definitely recommend these diapers and will continue to use!

    These diapers are awful. The elastic is way too stretchy so every bit of pee just weighs it down and it gets incredibly saggy within a few pees. With the sag, it left rashes on the inside of my daughters thighs. This picture is as the rash was finally healing. It was fire red a few days ago. I will never buy these again. I also don‚Äôt find them near absorbent as regular diapers.

    Our 2-year old loves these. We are not read for potty training yet, but our toddler is, so these are perfect for her to sit on a potty any time she wants. She actually changes her own diapers and gets dress, they are easy to remove when there is a poop inside, I just wish it had better tape for closing diaper before disposal, it's a bit of a mess with current system.

    My baby does not lay down for diaper changes, its always a struggle to get the diaper with the tabs on properly. I even had to master the art of 'changing a baby while they walk/crawl around', it was nuts. No one could change the kid except me! Very frustrating, but not anymore! These bad boys slip on and baby is off and running within seconds. I don't have to worry about leaks or blow outs since they have great coverage all around and the sides tearing off for easy disposable is key. I'm super happy with these diapers and wish I'd known about them sooner.

    These are pretty good diapers. Easy to put on, stays on without coming off when baby moves. My baby has a small waist, so I was doubtful if these would stay tight. They did! I don't like scented diapers much, so the scent this diaper has was a put off. But not to the extent that I won't buy these again!! Lol

    These diapers are amazing for our little mover. Diaper changes are a lot less stressful now that we can just slip them on. There are obvious difficulties with applying diaper cream but you just need to find a different way that works for you. The scent of the diapers is pretty strong, I find all Pampers diapers are like that. Definitely no strong pee smell though when they are full. Would strongly recommend these diapers to anyone with a baby that will not stay still for diaper changes!

    These diapers leak horribly, I have had at least one leak a day since using these on my 15 month old.  Also because they are pull ups and rip offs, if you have a mess in a diaper you have a mess everywhere when you take them off.  Do not recommend unless you are in a potty training phase, otherwise stick to swaddlers

    We tried many pull up style diapers after my daughter decided that laying down for a diaper change is not happening, and these won. They're the most comfortable, don't pinch or bunch up, have a decent bum coverage and they never leaked. Not once, even overnight.
  
"

    We bought these diapers by mistake and wow what a mistake that was. The pull up style is good in theory but you have to fully undress your child to put them on. Meaning if they have pants and socks that you would typically leave around their ankles you can‚Äôt, it sounds silly but trying to do a quick diaper change or one in winter with lots of layers is impossible.The BIGGEST problem I have with these is the outside tape, first off good for pretty much an empty diaper as it barely fits around it. Good luck if you had any sort of mess too. Second is the tape on the outside rips open the diaper genie bags because it gets stuck and pulls and more get added. These are awful and just totally impractical, good in theory but terrible in practice.

    My son can barley sit still for a diaper change and the Velcro tabs always dug in leaving red marks. Now diaper changes are 100000000x easier and no red marks at all.I was also having leaking issues at night and I think because these are so stretchy they get truly get a perfect fit around my toddler and no more leaks!!!

    I've been using the Pampers Cruisers for my son once he started walking around and have always had very high praise for Pampers and their products. Noticed that Walmart had size 7s so was using those and felt so bad because the tape was starting to leave marks on my lil guy. Then I seen Amazon had the 360 version of the 7s so I thought I'd jump right on that. I literally held up a regular size 7 cruiser diaper to the 360 version and while they look physically the same size the 360 does NOT have the stretch I was expecting. I thought these were going to be so much better for my son but they suck. It takes twice as long to put it on him because I'm trying to gently ease it on him so it doesnt rip I mean once they are on they seem ok just hard to get over his thicker thighs plus no idea how it is going to be when he goes #2. Thankfully I am home all day with him and can keep an eye on him to make sure there are no blow outs.I'd like to say that I'd recommend these but if they were just a smidge stretchier Id be happy

    I normally love all pamper products but not these. They did not fit my daughter well, she‚Äôs got a big bum and little waist and they were so awkward and gapped in weird places but didn‚Äôt have enough room for her bum. If your kiddo has big hips and a little bum then they would probably work. I was super disappointed in these and super bummed I decided to try them at all.

    My wiggly baby refuses to lie down unless she's fast asleep, so these are a life saver.  They go on easily, fit like a dream, and seem to be quite absorbent - we're half way through the box and haven't had any leaks yet.  My only argument against these is the scent.  I do not for the life of me understand why Pampers insists on scenting their diapers.  Thankfully my baby doesn't seem to be allergic to it but I've heard of lots of kids who are, so keep that in mind.  Once my kid is big enough for size 4s we'll likely switch to the Huggies version since they don't pump their stuff full of perfumes - we only bought the Pampers ones because they start at size 3, unlike the Huggies.

    I like it that it was scented, i like the design. Its also absorbent. But i don‚Äôt like that it was so big. It keeps on falling off my baby especially if it is a bit full but not much( it was like she only peed 2 times then it starts falling off her), she cannot enjoy her time by pulling up again and again.. My baby is using easy ups size 6 but falling off is not a problem to her. Also when i tried to compare the easy ups size 6 and cruisers 360 size 6 its really way too big.

    My granddaughter moves around a lot! even trying to stand on her own (still too young).  These diapers have been so appreciated.  Whatever direction she takes, the diaper follows with full protection.They stretch at the waist which means that she never has that feeling of restricted movements.  Whether she has gained a few ounces makes a difference at that age and the stretchy waistline can be adjusted.The taps are surprisingly secure and easy to work with.The best, of course, is that these diapers absorb A LOT! We change her diaper frequently during the day and have never seen any kind of rash or irritation.Love these.

    I've changed a lot of diapers in the last 4 years, with 3 little ones under 5. We've changed back and forth between some versions of Pampers or Huggies, but these take the cake.Our squirmy 12-month old is no match for the slide-on style diaper. It was nearly impossible to get a normal diaper on without her squirming away. Especially the Huggies diapers with the extra ""velcro"" strips on the side. I got so fed up. Then I saw these new 360 fit ones and will never go back.The sides tear really easily for removal, so you're not having to navigate a wet or dirty diaper off the babes and there's a pull tab sticker on the back to wrap it up before going in to the garbage/diaper genie. Highly recommend.

    We bought this due to the positive reviews that say that this diaper prevented overnight leaking. It was promising at first, for the first week it seemed the have prevented leaking, but since then, our 21 month old boy who is about 12kg (26 pounds) still seems to leak through at least half of the nights. Even double diapering didn't help with this significantly.Still overall a great diaper, as it is very soft, and seems very comfortable, but unfortunately for the purpose we bought it, did not work.

    We definitely like these diapers. They are comfy, soft and absorbent. The only thing - they may run small, my baby is 10 months old with weight 9,5 kilos now and size 4 fits her better. But they don‚Äôt last very long if the child is a heavy wetter, for us it‚Äôs 3 hours, which is quite Ok (we use reusable cloth diapers at home, these ones are for going out). I rate it as 5 stars.

    ¬†These strapless diapers fit much better than expected; We didn't have any issues with leakage and the fit is perfect for our 6 month old infant. Not due to the construction of the diaper, I do find this harder to put on because our infant likes to flail his legs rapidly while getting a diaper change.As for the removal, I appreciate that the sides can be torn and diaper has a built-in tape strap on the back for rolling up. I like that these diapers do have a yellow stripe for wetness indication; They do hold quite a bit of capacity versus size 3 diapers. We chose to move from size 3 when there was accidental leakage and the diapers could not contain larger messes.With a soft construction and very stretchy sides, our infant seems comfortable in these without any issues; These diapers do have a perfume and I don't notice any irritation nor redness from our infant wearing these. Our infant is not quite at that stage where we can start potty training; However, these are a great fit for a very active baby and perhaps you don't like dealing with straps.

    We were originally using Pampers Baby Dry, and loved how well they held up overnight. These 360 Cruisers are a similar style to pull-up diapers (we already use and love Pampers Easy-ups for our toddler). The main difference I've noticed between them is that Easy-ups are sized by age, while the 360s use standard diaper sizes and are also available for infants/younger babies.I feel like you'll know if the 360s are the right diaper for your baby, based on what's already happening with their diaper. My 7 month old son is extremely active - crawling, cruising and climbing. He also loves to flip over and peace out during diaper changes. He's so active that he stretches out/bursts the elastics around his legs in standard diapers, which also gives him friction burns, and the diapers just generally look completely disheveled after he's had them on for a short time. There is also always a huge gap at the back. We could literally see my son's bum crack when he was crawling around. If he pooped, it would easily flow out of the back of the diaper if it was a lot, or if he was laid on his back.We also found the velcros on standard diapers weren't foolproof. If Grandma did a diaper change, she would never fasten the velcros tight enough for him (she's afraid of hurting him, but they need to be fastened tight!) so the diapers would be too loose and slip off his bum once he peed a few times.The 360 Cruisers solve ALL of these issues for us. We love them so far. There's no gaps, they keep up with our active son, and no guessing how tight velcros should be.I've seen some reviewers complaining about having to take baby's shoes and pants off in order to change this diaper - I didn't necessarily find that to be an issue. Probably because we're already used to using Easy-ups in our household. However, I also keep a bunch of the Baby Dry diapers at home and in our diaper bag in case I need to do a quick diaper change where taking his pants or shoes off isn't practical. I also prefer to use the Baby Dry ones at night.

    So these are awesome! The youngest ward in my care HATES having his diaper changed and rolls around constantly. With these, I can just pull down, quick wipe, then pull on another one while he's standing, and he doesn't think of it as changing time.  For poops, I still have to wrestle him down, but the sides tear free for tidy cleanup. To compensate for not having velcro tab to tuck it into a ball, there's a little piece of tape applied on the back that you release and use to wrap it up for disposal.Good waistband fit and they don't sag while running around. Very soft, and hold a lot of pee overnight.

    Pampers diapers are great they have been our go-to brand for our first baby and we are still figuring out what's working for our second baby but the nice thing is that they have a nice tall back on them so that helps to prevent blowouts and to keep them contained. Pampers also has stretchy legs and nice Velcro around the waist to keep it in place. The designs are simple and cute. In the largest boxes of the Pampers diapers you seem to get the best deal and I highly recommend buying them on Amazon under subscribe and save because of the additional 20% that you could save.

    Pampers cruisers 360 degree fit are the perfect diaper choice for little ones on the go. My 2 and a half year old fits perfectly in these and I love that they resemble a pull up. Its easier to use for potty training because it has no tabs, you can easily pull it up and down like regular underwear but have the peace of mind that it will absorb any pee or poops. This pack comes with 62 diapers and I think it is a great value for the money.

    Bought these for a 7mth old that doesn't stop moving and also for overnight wear as being a boy, he would constantly pee out the side....these have pretty much remedied that problem. I usually change him in the middle of the night and these are quick on and off so he doesnt wake and I'm not fumbling in the dark with tabs and such. Also he tends to spit up with the tab diapers ehen sitting cuz they dig in but he doesn't with these. I cloth diaper alot but go to these for nights and those days where im just too tired to be doing laundry! Love them!

    My baby not only fights nappy changes but is a constant mover even when sleeping. So when it wasn't even enough that we changed his tape diaper from size 3 to 4 for better absorbency, it was time to try these pull-ups again. I had tried these in size 3 originally but it gave my baby a rash. Now with the size 4, I'm happy to say he currently doesn't leak at night and it's a lot easier to get him into them without kicks and screams.Choosing diapers for your baby is a constant moving target due to their different needs and growth. Some trial and error will be had. But at least for my baby's current needs, these have been a great option.

    These Pampers 360 Diapers are the perfect diaper for babies and toddlers that are on-the-go but aren‚Äôt ready for Potty Training and Easy-Ups. What sets them apart from other diapers is the 360¬∞ stretchy waistband and the dual leak-guard barriers around the legs which really help to prevent leaks and keep messes contained. They also have ‚ÄúLockAway‚Äù channels that quickly absorb wetness to keep your baby dry and leak-free.Thanks to the tear away sides, they can easily be pulled on and off so I can easily change my busy and wiggly daughter. The wetness indicator is also one of my favourite features because I can physically see that she needs to be changed rather than having to stop her to check her diaper every so often. They also have a little piece of tape attached to the back which makes rolling it up and disposing of the diaper much easier.I appreciate that they are hypoallergenic and free from parabens, latex and elemental chlorine bleaching. They are made from natural rubber and have never given my daughter rashes or any irritation.If you are looking for a diaper that moves with your active child, is very absorbent and is super easy to put on/remove then I would give these a try. Highly recommend!

    I have a lean 1 year old who weights 21 lbs. I tried size 4 and wasn't sure if they would stay up but the top part is very long and stretchy so it fits him.  Recently, he has started to pull up the tabs of his other diapers and take them partially off. Because of this, I am so glad for Pampers Cruises 360. It is nice that they don't have any tabs for my baby to pull off. At first I thought it would be messy to remove but when I read that they have easy tear sides, they come off just like a regular diaper - I don't have to pull it down and risk getting po0p on his legs. If he doesn't have much of a mess, I will just pull them down. I also like them because they are husband-fool proof! My husband constantly has trouble with the tabs and leaves the front parts all bunched up, no matter how many times I show him how to stretch and smooth them out. So with these, there is nothing to get bunched up, he just pulls it up and they fit! I also like that they still have a wetness indicator strip.I am pleasantly surprised with how much I like these!! The only harder part is to have to shimmy them up to get them on but now that he is a year old, he likes standing up so I can pull them up the rest of the way when he stands!

    These diapers are great. When you have a baby who just doesn‚Äôt want to lay down for quick diaper changes, these are a must-have. These are pull-on style diapers but they‚Äôre better than the typical potty training diaper as they are just as absorbent as a regular diaper. The waistband is soft and comfortable. It has really food stretch to it without being saggy. I like that the sides are really easy to rip allowing for quick changes. I also think the little included tape for wrapping the used diaper is smart since there aren‚Äôt any tabs like regular diapers. The absorbency is great and bowel movements stay inside the diaper and don‚Äôt come out the leg holes or up the back. I am really happy with these diapers.

    Why does pampers make so many scented diapers- and why isn‚Äôt it made clearer that they are. I was excited to upgrade to a pull- up style because my lo hates laying down on the table to have it done. I found that they were easy to pull on and off though still reds to lay down to wipe bottom. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt like to use unnatural scents especially in delicate areas so I tried one and now I want to return the whole box.

    It's very absorbent, fits comfortably, and isn't scratchy. It is the best fitting diaper we have ever found. It is the one diaper that won't leave rub marks on her skin too. No matter ehat size or brand, the others would make rub marks. These have made such a positive difference that I am willing to spend more to order them from offline than purchase any other diaper available from our store down the street.

    I‚Äôm obsessed with Pampers 360s! They seem to scare a lot of people since they don‚Äôt have velcro sides like Pull-Ups brand diapers do. I prefer this over those! They‚Äôre also a little longer, meaning the waistband goes up higher in the front and back. This gives them more coverage for possible blowouts. They‚Äôre not an underwear-fit like some training pants are (like Hello Bello‚Äôs) but more like a diaper with an elastic waist.They‚Äôre really soft and super absorbent. If you‚Äôve used Pampers Cruisers, they‚Äôre pretty much the same absorbency and offer the same amount of leak protection. I think they run slightly bigger than regular Cruisers or Huggies Little Movers do..... which is GREAT if you‚Äôre little one is between sizes or outgrowing 7‚Äôs in regular diapers. My son is between diaper sizes at the moment, phasing out of size 6 and into size 7. He can still get away with wearing the 360s in size 6, but can also wear these if I roll the waistband down a bit. I‚Äôm still not a fan of using these overnight, but they work in a pinch. I put my son in a night diaper like Pampers Ninjamas.The sides rip easily when it‚Äôs time to take these off. There‚Äôs a little sticky tape in the back if you wanted to roll them up and throw them away as a bundle. I never use that though....The only annoying thing is that you pretty much HAVE to take their pants off to put these on (I had become a pro at putting diapers on without taking his pants off). We started using these when my son began rolling around and standing during diaper changes. It‚Äôs so much easier to use these when standing up!I highly recommend trying them. They‚Äôre also great for potty training, because they‚Äôre easy to pull on and off. Pre-potty training, if your little one has started taking regular diapers off, these seem to be harder for them to pull down (before 18 months or so). If you need your baby to keep a diaper on these might work!As far as sizing goes, I recommend getting your kiddo‚Äôs regular size; they just may seem  a little bigger in the waist. Hope this helps! üòâ

    These pampers 360 Pull Ups are great for toddlers in the throws of potty training. They fit true to size, are very similar to ""big kid"" undies, and hold a great amount of liquid when needed. They do a great job of containing any accidents, especially if your child is up moving around, it easily wicks moisture away from the skin, and is overall a great training diaper.

    Love pampers so when we needed this size went to these.  I would say these are like other pamper cruisers. They absorb well and fit true to size.  They look like underwear which is important to potty training. My son wears them with no issues.  The overnight absorbency is okay but would not give my kid a lot of water before bed.  Overall very satisfied.

    Pampers are my go to brand. Yes, they‚Äôre pricier than most nappy (diaper) brands but you pay for quality! The gap free guarantee is brilliant! They keep my 2 year old from leaking & I love the handy line/ indicator and design of the nappies. They‚Äôre soft & as my son is a large 2 year old, I‚Äôm glad that they go up to a size 7. Potty training just got easier!

    As always with Pampers, these diapers are great quality! If properly place, you won't have leaking problems (at least God thanks I haven't had any). Reliable during day and night, when my girl is active and while she's resting. I find this to be at a fair price point for the quality of the products and you'll get them delivered to your door with no delays :)

    As of mother of two little children I need to use a lot of diapers every day. I think I tried almost all diaper brands. I love and trust Pampers brand. The quality of these diapers good as always. My children's skin is not sensitive, so they never had any irritation or other problem. My child's weight is about 40 pounds and size 7 fits him well. These diapers have a higher and stretchy waistband than regular diapers. They are very absorbent. They hold liquid good, no leaking so far. Great for active toddlers and as overnight diapers. These diapers a good way to teach how to pull on/off training pants. The sides tear off easily to remove the diapers without any mess.

    Product: Pampers Diapers Pull On Cruisers 360¬∞ Fit Disposable Baby Diapers with Stretchy Waistband Enormous Pack Packaging May Vary, 70 CountNot sure of the price difference, but these are very much like potty training diapers. The only thing I find very different is that there 360s come with a small tab to keep the diaper closed when disposing (see first picture). The absorbency is great. The stretch is great. Our kiddos actually don't need a size 7 just yet but there is no dashing or leaking despite it being too large at this point. Absorbency is what you'd expect with pampers-it can make it through the night no problems. Nice product.

    This family has used Pampers Cruisers a few years back for one girl in the family.  Although they‚Äôre always trying to improve, I don‚Äôt see how they can.  Everyone is a fan of different types of diapers for different reasons.  No two babies are alike and comparing Pampers to Huggies is like comparing apples to oranges so I‚Äôm not going to talk about the two, but rather just about these Pampers Cruisers.  For example, some babies are taller than others and sometimes one diaper that will work for one toddler won‚Äôt work for another.Sometimes even generics work, but I chose to use cloth diapers and then at a later stage, Pampers.  We chose to use the during the night because they were extra absorbent and had a snug fit.  Not that anyone cares, but I do love the different graphics Pampers comes out with.  Of course, I like the dryness and fit factor even more.These Pampers Cruisers are just for the child they say they are and, in this case, for 41 pounds and up.  The toddler or young child who is really starting to move around.  There have been a lot of improvements in the past couple of years, especially in managing to keep things in when there is a blowout.  One other thing is that the leakage protection is great not only for overnight, but also when you are in the on-the-go mode.

    These toddler pull-on type diapers are great. They pull up and down like underwear for potty training. But you can rip the sides easily to take them off. There is even a little tape in the back so if you want to roll up the dirty diaper and secure it in a ball, you can do so, like a diaper. They smell like baby powder which I love. Pampers never disappoints!

    This 70 pack of size 7 cruisers/ pullups comes in two packs of 35 each.The diapers are rated for 41lbs+ (19kg+).They fit my 49 pound  5 year old great. Not too loose and not tight.The sides are solid fused so they can't come apart while pulling up or down.The absorbent padding doesn't go all the way up the front or back- it gets to within 3 inches of the top of the front and 4 inches from the top of the back. I've had issues with similar diapers that leaked overnight from not enough coverage there and although I haven't had any leaks yet I feel it might happen with these.They have that powder fresh pamper scent.

    This is perfect for overnight protection, they fit so nicely and very soft and comfortable almost like an underwear fit. Biggest thing that stands out with this vs other popular brands that it doesn‚Äôt have Velcro on the size that often would irritate skin and make it itch. It‚Äôs very stretchy so it would really fit any toddler. As far as absorbency it does do a good job holding on accident but I‚Äôm not using it as a diaper, mostly only for ‚Äújust in case‚Äù, as we pretty much done with potty training. I love pampers and always trust it thru all stages with my little ones!

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers size 7 work great for the mobile baby.  Actually, more like big kid since this is (or should be) a potty training diaper.  Good stretch, especially when kiddo decides to pull on them while ""helping"".  Adequate leak protection and absorption, even overnight.  And I didn't notice skin pinching or  irritation.  The sides also tear easily for throwing away.  No hangups.  I've never had an issue with Pampers.  I like you get such a big box in this size.  That's new to me.

    My 9 month old is going through the phase of hating diaper changes so she does everything in her power to roll and crawl away. we tried EVERY brand of diaper in the world. From the very expensive to the least expensive. Invariably, our son would over fill those diapers! Far too many mornings he would wake up very happy and very wet. Now, he's 13 months and it's been fortunate he learned to sleep for 10-11 hours nightly very early on. But we couldn't find a diaper that could stay dry.

    I love these diapers! They are super soft on my toddler's skin and absorb everything. They don't leak. I love how these are super stretch, because my baby is a mover! They don't rip or fall off. Pampers price point is always awesome for the amount and quality. I love the fun designs. These are amazing compared to other diaper brands!

    I ordered more of these so that we can work on nighttime potty training. These go on like underwear but absorb like a diaper. My toddler is daytime potty trained but doesn‚Äôt wake at night on her own.I like that they pull up and down easily. I can go to  wake her up in the night to take a quick trip to the toilet and get her back to bed without adjusting diaper straps. She says they‚Äôre comfortable. And in the morning they rip off easily.

    Like other pamper diapers, my kids never have had problems with them.  These work well for my growing and moving boy with those stretchy sides.  The easy to pull sides and tape that is included is a nice little added bonus for securing and tossing everything away. Most importantly no issues with leaking or bulky sides that allows things to escape.  The diapers are easy to pull up (and down to remove.)

    We have always found Pampers to be great diapers with nice feeling material and nice fit, and these are no exception.Just keep in mind that diaper fit is super subjective; one of our kids always used Pampers, one we used Huggies.So, while I recommend these, you might want to try out a variety of diaper options and see what works best for your kiddo.

    These diapers are so cute (pattern) and they do a great job. We rarely, if ever, have any accidents with these Pampers.Some pros about these diapers:- cute designs- indicates which side is for ‚Äúback‚Äù, saving me time trying to figure it out- slip on, rip off design- stretchy banded waist, movable with active babies- pee indicator (SO important)- sticky tab to help seal and contain dirty diapers- soft and absorbentCons:- just wish these were biodegradable and not so bad for landfills, but that‚Äôs my wish for ALL diapersBottom line:These pretty much check all the boxes of the things I look for in a diaper. Baby‚Äôs happy, mommy and daddy‚Äôs happy!

    Comparing these to Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants - these seem to be able to absorb more, have much softer sides and have a more baby-like design (as opposed to toddler design). The tear sides to remove work as well as in Easy Ups Training Pants but these also have a disposal tape that helps you compress this into the bin and minimize smell and mess by keeping the excrement inside after throwing out.I think the different designs and patterns are really sweet and minimalist without in-your-face movie characters etc.The quality I learned to expect from Pampers is always on point, these are no different. We did not experience blowouts or premature rips that would make you throw away a perfectly clean diaper.Size 7 is quite big, if size 6 is not big enough for your needs than it is a great option.These are for your child if you find the value better than other pull up offers from Pampers or other brands, it is certainly high quality. The soft and flexible sides are a real plus.

    I got these for my 3rd child who is 3 years old. Maybe I‚Äôm losing it, but I could have sworn with my other 2 kids the pampers cruisers were just regular diapers, not pull ups. It‚Äôs also my fault for not really looking into the description since I just assumed they would be just regular pamper cruisers. But to be fair they don‚Äôt really advertise it on the box or make it very clear. Of course I am still using them, there just not what I expected.The pull-up itself is exactly what I have come to expect from pampers, soft and comfortable on my child, and good leak protection. They are also movement friendly and have the perfect amount of stretch in both the legs and stomach. I guess the new thing about these is the tape that makes it easier to wrap and throw away since it doesn‚Äôt have adjustable sides like regular diapers for wrapping. I‚Äôve got to admit this does come in handy though! Overall I‚Äôm happy with these! Just make sure your aware that these are pull-up style, not regular diapers!

    My five-year-old grandson has been potty trained for years, but still has nighttime accidents a couple of times a week. We had tried various pee pads, ""waterproof"" mattress covers, and nighttime diapers, but I would always have to wash all of his bedding, and his mattress. We have always used Pampers on our babies, and once again they did not disappoint. He has stopped having large accidents since we got these, but he has had several smaller accidents and these have been great. He can put them on himself, unlike a diaper, but they fit like a diaper. They also have the Pampers wetness indicator, which is great because if he wakes up dry I know we can use the diaper another night. Another plus is that you can take it off and roll it up like a diaper and secure it with the little tape strip- very helpful for messy diapers. Wish I had bought these years ago and saved myself a ton of laundry and stress.

    I figured I would try these for our son since we are in the process of potty training and figured these would be easier to use. I will say I loved how roomy the size 7 was with him being 3 and 25lbs these fit him perfectly. I think the only thing that was difficult about these is that for example our son can take his diaper to the garbage to throw away these when you tear the sizes to change him have a little tape at the back that helps to roll it closed but the sizes are still open so depending on how messy of a diaper were talking about here these weren't convenient in a sense that a diaper you can seal it up all the way sides and all. The other thing is these left behind pieces of the pamper which were extremely difficult to fully get off of him in between changes. In all these wouldn't be something we would look at buying or choosing again in the future.

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 is amazing when you have a toddler on the moved, your tot can just step right into these. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest these for the younger crowd though. I remember trying these way back when for my higher percentile child and they didn‚Äôt work for her then, we did have leaks. They work great for us now though.The waist band is stretchy and cozy for my little gal, she even said she likes it! You just rip the sides when you‚Äôre done and roll it up and there‚Äôs a tap tab and then that is all. It‚Äôs as simple as that. As I said this is idea for that tot who is on the go, my gal is definitely on the go and she is so excited stepping, well jumping into these. We‚Äôve had no issues, I can see these forming to all different body types too. I definitely suggest these.

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360¬∞ Fit Disposable Baby Diapers are perfect for daytime use for kids who are ready to potty train. They do on as underwear and have a stretchy waistband and fused-together sides, so can go up and down multiple times if needed. The design is unisex and would work for both boys and girls. There is a wetness indicator strip so you (or your kid) can get a visual clue that the diaper needs to be changed.I would recommend using them during daytime and switching to a more absorbent overnight diaper before bedtime becase the absorbent pad doesn't go all the way to the waistband on the back and in our experience with similar diapers it may cause leaks at night. I haven't tried them at night for this reason, but they work great during the day.

    I got these Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 fit for my daughter who currently hates wearing regular diapers. She wants to wear a diaper like wearing a pant, which she doesn't need to lay down when changing diapers. This is her first time trying out 360 fit pull on diapers and she loves them a lot! These diapers are soft and comfortable to wear. The waist band is stretchy but tight enough to prevent leaks. I let her wear these pull on in the day time when she is able to tell me when she's ready to go potty. I also like how sweet it is to include a secure tape, so you can roll up then tape the used diaper before throwing into trash can! Overall, I am 100% satisfied with this product and will continue to use it! Highly recommend!

    I recently ordered a box of Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants and I love them.  But there are 2 aspects of the Easy Ups that I don't like.  First, there is no wetness indicator.  The only way to know if it's time to change them is to pull them down and take a look.  Second, you can't easily tell which side is the front and which side is the back.  Well, I am happy to say that these Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 Diapers fix both of those problems!  Plus they do just as good of a job at keeping my son dry as the Easy Ups do.  So in the future I will probably buy these diapers instead.  These Cruisers are great for potty training.  My son loves them because they are so comfortable and easy to pull down when he needs to.
