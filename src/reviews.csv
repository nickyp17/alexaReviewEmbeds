    I simply bought these for my 6 yr old grandson. He picked them out.  He's not into having expensive cards but simply likes to collect.  He's quite happy with them.

    Packaging was very sus and looked to be resealed. I got 6 packs and got 2 halo and a umbreon vmax. Packaging could be factory mistake as why packs are only 5$ each which is very fair. Def worth the buy. Seller was Luigi Cards. 10/10

    I haven't opened Any of my packs yet. There are signs of them being  Re sealed. Pictures don't do justice. The packs themselves feel loose and not normal, You can clearly see where it has been opened and re sealed. The markings of the re seals, melt marks.  Etc.

    The top and bottom lines of the packs are both uneven ( on all three packs) , one of them had glue residues on the exterior of the seal and this one alongside another one had glue residue on the inside of the seal. The pulls weren’t absolutely terrible but weren’t great either and i did get one holo per pack but that stops there. Wouldn’t recommend. Very disappointed.

    Of course you won't get the packs shown because as time passes they'll cycle in the newer cheaper packs. I managed to pull a full art trainer out of a chilling reign booster. However, one of the boosters seemed to be missing a code card... that same pack had a non-holo rare in it.... do with that information what you will. (I'm only leaving 3 stars because of it.)

    First and foremost, this was purchased from K STAMPS, so I'm referring to my experiences with products from them. Nothing else.I ordered one set of 3 packs and received the following: Roaring Skies, Primal Clash and Darkness Ablaze. The primal clash was the pack I felt was resealed, so I decided to take a closer look at all the cards I got after opening it. One of the cards, a Treecko, stuck out because while the other cards in the pack were dated 2015, the Treecko was dated 2014. I'm not saying it's fake, because I know there were prints of Treecko in 2014, but it's not normal to get cards of different years in the same pack. Add to that the slit I found at the top of the pack, and it looks suspicious. The other packs looked fine and I did get a decent pull, but that one pack was definitely tampered with.I contacted K STAMPS, and they assured me that they don't tamper with the cards at all. They stated they actually send the envelopes of 3 packs each to amazon in bulk, which explains why they are fulfilled by amazon. However, the envelope I got was sealed and didn't look damaged at all or like it had been opened before. So, is it K STAMPS or Amazon workers tampering with these cards? At this point, it could be either as I honestly have no clue.TL:DR: One of the packs was resealed, and I'm upset.

    Fraudulent items. These cards have very clearly been opened and resealed. The card backs differ in colour within one pack, some cards have scratches on them and the print dates on the cards differ within one pack. One pack felt bumpy - poor reseal job, the other two had fairly large unsealed corners. It was hard to get good pictures, but it's very obvious in person - especially the colour differences and the scratches. Brutal.

He’s just starting to collect Pokémon cards & was beyond pleased with the 3 packages he received!Just because of some bad reviews, we had a friend (a long-time Pokémon card collector) check over the cards & packaging to ensure that we were getting what we had paid for. The cards & packaging we received are brand new, not resealed, and authentic.I am also pleased with the customer service I received after purchasing. The seller responded quickly and was very friendly & accommodating.I will be purchasing more cards from this seller in the future

    I read many reviews warning that these had been resealed packs. But then some reviews had indicated that they got great pulls and all were factory sealed. So I took a chance and only ordered 3 packs. So this review is based on a small sample size.All the reviews indicating that these are resealed are fact. This company clearly goes to great efforts to reseal them as to the naked eye one probably can't tell. But anyone who knows what to look for can easily tell. And these were certainly resealed. I was disappointed before I had even opened the packs.Once I opened them, the clear indicator was that the card counts were off. A booster pack consists of 10 randomly sorted cards  and guaranteed to have 6 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare. Each blister will also have at least 1 foil card.What did I get?4 - rares11 - Uncommons15 commons3 of these cards were foil cards.At first glance you immediately think that this is a great pull as I got 1 additional rare and 2 additional uncommon. You are right, based on pure rarity counts, it's a good pull. But not everything is treated equal. And the fact the counts are off is your proof that they have been tampered with. And despite the additional rarities, every card was mediocre at best with little to no value.A card and collectibles store in my area sells blister packs(opened) for 5$ a pop. The key difference here is that they TELL you they have been opened and they TELL you that you won't get anything other than standard rares. But that is why they only charge 5$. And the pulls you would expect is exactly what you would are probably going to get from this company.I can't say DONT buy them. Just buyer beware. These have been resealed. Might be a good gift at a cheaper price for young kids getting into Pokemon. Collectors should absolutely look elsewhere.Hopefully this review was helpful.

    1 out of 6 packs had an ok card. Bought more from a reputable dealer in town and it was a completely different experience. These packs are 100% weighed opened and resealed I have no idea how amazon can allow the sale of this stuff. There isnt a single pokemon dealer on here that isnt rated horribly for resealing. Disgusting.

    The packs are clearly not reseated and are official, usually get good pulls when I order this product, but the false advertising is a let down. It is advertised in the photo that this includes three random X/Y series packs, nowhere does it say that you are getting modern packs even though I have payed for what was advertised. Either change how this product is presented or follow up on your promise. I have ordered this item many times, and not once have I ever even seen a single Sun/Moon or X/Y pack, even though that is what I payed for. Please make up for this in some way. False advertising is not cool.

    A very good selection of packs. Ordered 5 times so far and have always got more than my moneys worth when compared to other sellers on here and online auction sites.I am a Pokemon collector and can confirm that none of the packs i received had been tampered with.As with being weighed i would say that they haven't due to me getting some ultra rare pulls but you can never be certain with loose packs.This is just my opinion from the 15 packs i have had so far from this seller. I have ordered other packs from Kstamps and never had any problems and will be ordering more.

    11 cards per pack, clearly states 10 on packaging.Comparison picture to that of some packs bought at Asda. Top row is Asda, bottom these booster packs…. 3vs3 packs I find it hard to believe.Sure luck is always to account for when opening these, but with the blatant resealing (poor glue, lines not matching and of course as above 11 cards).Do yourself a favour save your money unless you’re just starting out, even then money is better spent on legit packs!

    My 7-year old purchased three packs from his hard earned chore money after reading the description and anticipating at least some valuable cards. He cried in utter disappointment after waiting two weeks for them to arrive (we are military overseas) saying: “They are all weak Pokémon.” There were no EX in either of the packs nor any other special Pokémon. I know that there is no guarantee but seeing your child cry and asking if he can get his money back was heartbreaking. I’d suggest changing the description of the product.

    Pokemon cards are really only good value for money because they cause such joy for the child collector who receives them, which is priceless. I do think they are too expensive, as a small pack is £4 where I live with only a few cards in the pack and so many cards are needed for a good collection.

    I don't know if I should be mad or happy. So i purchased these just simply thinking it was a good deal. Like many who have posted on here I too experienced some tampering with the product. One of the packs there wasn't even an energy card, not really complaining because over the years of collecting I have enough energy cards lol. However, All packs come with at least one energy card unless you get a holo energy. That same pack I got 3 rare cards. Am I upset about that? Not at all. However I can tell that some one also probably weighted 2 of the packs to guarantee I would not get a rare holo like one post on here. I probably won't buy from here again. Due to the sketchy things going on. I've learned from this mistake.  I did get some cards I needed but on the other hand I would have preferred to get an honest pack than a tampered one.

    Well, I figured for $10, I'd take a chance and see what I got. Not knowing which cards or pack you'll get is half the fun anyway. I wasn't hoping for much card wise, but I was at least hoping to get something as far back as Black/White. I got two packs of XY Roaring Skies and one of XY Primal Clash - both of which I could've bought at the nearest toy store, so that was kinda disappointing. Out of them, the only thing of worth was a reverse rare Banette. So, I can't say if they're weighted or not. It might just be I had bad pulling luck. Might give them the benefit of the doubt and try again at a later date.3/16/16 - I decided to give these sellers another try. Since I've been collecting, I've gotten into collecting the coins and pins you can find in some boosters and packs. So this time I purchased (2) Three Random Booster Packs from VGMX, which stated I would get an extra coin and promo/holofoil card. Foolishly, I assumed that it would be three random packs, a coin and a promo from varying sets or previous boosters or whatever that had already been opened and distributed for sale. What I got was legitimately 2 blisters, resulting in all of my ""random"" packs being Breakthrough. Seeing as it would likely cost me half as much to send the packages back as paying for them, I decided to just accept the fact that they weren't random and opened them to see what I got. I got two reverse rares out of the packs, aside from the holo promos that came with the blisters. Something seemed fishy, but I figured that you can't really weight boosters, right?3/30/16 - Wanting to solve the mystery once and for all, I purchased a gram scale so that I could weight the packs I buy from different stores and sellers, to see which places were the safest to buy cards. I decided to give this ONE LAST shot. So I bought 3 packs of Three Random Boosters, nine packs total, from Swift Buy. They arrived today and, honestly, I'm surprised that I was as hopeful as I was. But when I opened it and saw that my ""random"" boosters were in packs of three, resulting in three packs of 2 XY Base Set and 1 Flashfire almost with the exact same art too, I knew I was screwed. Still, I wanted to be dutiful and weighed each pack. It is as follows:X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.5 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.3 gramsX/Y Base w/ Blastoise Art = 18.5 gramsX/Y Base w/ Venosaur Art = 18.4 gramsFlashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.8 gramsFlashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.7 gramsFlashfire w/ Pyroar art = 19.7 gramsNeedless to say, after seeing those numbers, I was upset. So I opened them all and with EVERY SINGLE NON HOLO RARE I got, I just got more livid. The whole reason I bought nine was because I wanted to rule out any chance of my having just rotten pulling luck. With Pokémon cards, you are expected to get one EX/Ultra rare every 4 packs, MAYBE five if you have a bad day. But nine packs in one sitting with absolutely nothing to show for it? Statistically, it simply doesn't add up. Further, if you add my other two previous purchases, that's 18 BOOSTERS WITH NOTHING!Now, I'm willing to concede that the first time I bought from Swift Buy (when all I got was the reverse rare Banette), I just had bad pulling luck. And while it IS hard to weight boosters, it IS possible. But I chose to give VGMX the benefit of the doubt. But having bought 9 packs (for a total of 12) from Swift Buy with nothing but non-holo rares to show for it, I can - with complete confidence - tell you that there is absolutely nothing random about these packs. They clearly pull the best packs and then resell the duds to unsuspecting online buyers, probably in the hopes that an unsuspecting parent or grandparent buys them for their kids and will never bother to submit a complaint to Amazon.Well, Swift Buy, you aren't fooling me.DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! And only buy from VGMX if you're looking for pin-free blisters. My suggestion to you is to save your money and buy at your local stores. Either that, or go to eBay. That's where I'll be from now on.

    Previously I thought I was scammed from my items, but a few days ago I received them (originally was supposed to receive them on the 23 of February). For some reason they were all sent in three separate envelopes, two showing on the same day, one on another day. I got all three of them as sun and moon booster packs. Only one I had my suspicions of being tampered, but the other two seem fine. While I did end up getting my items, I had no means of communicating with the seller and had no means of refunding when I thought I was ripped off. I did only pay for 10+, but its still something consumers should be wary of. I would recommend purchasing elsewhere, but take caution when purchasing.

    all three packs were like the worst kind of dud packs, nothing in them,  one didn't even have a rare or a foil. like I said, dud packs.  I’m not accusing this seller however Pokémon cards are easily weighed out on a hand held scale revealing which ones will have a “hit” or not. These packs we received may have been the worst three packs we have ever opened.  I would caution anyone who is buying these to think about this before you spend all you kids gift cards on these three dud packs.

    Truth be told you are Gambling . You may or may not end up with tampered card packs. My cards were legit upon opening, very few duplicates,  cards in nice condition,  all the usual signs of a legit booster such as at least one rare, reverse holo, 11 cards. That's right! 11 cards. I know it says 10 cards,  goto the store , buy a pack, open it and count the cards. That aside I still feel my boosters were tampered with some areas as you can see in the photo seemed glues down where the shouldn't be, like the picture showcasing the back flap. Probably not the sellers fault as they were probably returned resealed.  Just nothing worth while out of 6 booster packs. Each pack had a rare card, but only 1 was holo. I always buy from the store at least three packs, and always have something NICE. Congrats to those who ordered and Got Exactly what they payed for and had something Great in them 😃! I'll be sticking to in store purchases until Amazon finds a way to Verify booster packs returns. Thanks for reading 📚.

I anticipated that the offering was similar to others of this type - where packs of recent overstocks are sent - but received 3 Fusion Strike packs, which have recently depreciated in value. I expected there to be some variation of modern packs. It's still a good deal, but I would purchase another lot if looking for a wider spread of sets. I took a chance on it because even though Steam Siege and Rebel Clash are less popular sets, they are ""old"" yet modern enough to maybe get thrown in. Good deal, but not for serious collectors.

    The packs are just the most recent packs. It's not actually ""random,"" it's just the most recent releases. My packs were 2 Fusion Strike and 1 Chilling Reign for a grand total of $15, which I could have gotten at Best Buy down my street for less. Not totally unhappy, as I did get a decent pull from one, but overall I would say I wasted my money.

    Packs you’ll get will probably be bad, definitely not any XY like in pics, i got 2 battle styles and 1 sun and moon, basically just overpaid for packs i just bought last week at a Walgreens i drove up to. Battle styles blisters have been sitting on shelves around here until there’s nothing better left. Packs just had crap reverse holos and no good pulls. If it’s all random then i must have bad luck, let’s hope it’s that and not weighing crappy packs to sell them off in groups of 3 lights.

    I dint understand some of the negative reviews about not getting a rare when the cards are obviously randomized. Please be aware that when you are buying these cards for kids or yourself that no rare holo or EX is garunteed. I myself have found two in one pack and can send a picture to prove it. I have already ordered multiple packs from this seller with a few more on the way (god I need help lol) but I can vouch that they are legitimate and sell quality and authentic products. I have tried the Pokémon TCG codes in the packs and they work.

    3 packs of chilling reign every time.The good reviews seem to be from people who don’t know much about the hobby.Packs are not sold loose like this unless you’re buying at a store that uses the full booster box as a display. Loose packs like these are usually weighed and separated so the seller has all the good cards.I’ve ordered this a few times over the span of a couple months to test a theory. All packs I’ve received weigh just about the same. All packs have been green code cards and no holo.Anyone can say what they want though, people will still buy these. Just know that it’s a carnival game you’re not going to win.

    My packs arrived in a larger envelope and inside they were sealed in separate bubble mailers with three packs In each. All of the packs were from CR, BS, and FS. I bought 10 so a total of 30 packs, in the first 15 I pulled two secret rares  and one VMAX. Overall I’m already happy with the purchase even if the rest of the packs are cold, and yes the cards are legit, def not fake

    This product is highly misleading. The product image is painfully out of date. If you're looking for some older packs and clicked this thinking you could find something unusual - don't.  The packs I got were Battle Styles, Chilling Reign and Fusion Strike. All very recent packs and nothing unusual at all. I can't confirm or deny the other people claiming the packs are resealed though.Pokemon has released 3-pack blisters for many years. This listing suggests a random one. What you get are 3 loose packs unprofessionally chucked in a bag. Which for the price is... fine. But this whole thing is misleading. They should be more clear that this is for 3, loose, random packs of whatever is in print.

    I bought 4 of these 3 packs a day or two after Christmas.  I received 4 wrapped chilling reign sandwiches with battle styles buns lol (2 battle styles and 1 chilling reign pack per 3).  I wouldn't say it was very random but at least they weren't all the same. Shipping arrived fairly quickly and I'm generally happy with this purchase.As with all cards, packs are a gamble of sorts and you never know what you're going to get.  These packs did not seem resealed to me, the back flap was not fully sealed to the top of the pack on some but I've also experienced boosters from the store like that as well so I did not dwell on it and opened to see what was inside.Overall an average pull rate in my opinion, I pulled 6 & 6 green and green/white code cards.  Actual card pulls revealed a secret rare gold Octillery and a Single Strike Urshifu VMAX, as well as a few holo rares.Before I purchased this product I checked the reviews for the SELLER.  Nearly 100% satisfaction in the last year so I decided to risk purchasing despite some poor reviews on the listing itself.  If you are thinking about buying, make an educated decision so you aren't disappointed with a bad one.  Hope this helps!

    My kid worked around the house to make enough to buy these booster packets. When I got them I looked them over to make sure they were untampered with, since it happens a lot. These were most definitely resealed. The pictures may not have the details to see what you can see in person but it is very noticeable. The ends of the packs were re-crimped and the ends didn’t match up/uneven. When opened, the glued sides stuck to each other and made it more obvious they were resealed.

    I bought 10 of these 3 booster pack sets  based on the pictures assuming that I would get a bunch of different boosters but I ended up getting 20 Astral Radiance and 10 Chilling Reign.Technically the buyer is indeed providing exactly what the listing says but I wish they wouldn’t use pics of old boosters because it gives a false impression that it’s possible to get non Sw/Sh boosters when in reality it’s not.Now that I am aware of that I can just go on EBay and pay $2.50 per booster and save $5.Bummer. This could have been really cool if it was what I thought it was based on the pictures.

    The best experience I have had getting pokemon cards. 10 cards per pack right to my door. Sealed beautifully in ready to go packages that I can use later on. 30 cards is perfect for a small video. 90 cards (3 of these purchases) for two guests is great for a long video or a stream. 3 different card generations helps to keep things interesting and ensure we never run out of Pokemon topics to talk about between the generations.  I will for sure be looking for this again down the road.

    It’s a hit or miss with Pokémon cards but painful when kids look at the pictures in description/advertisement of this seller and think they’ll get at least few good cards. We only got 1 decent card and many energy type cards.

    I bought these for kicks because of the good deal and even considered opening these on camera but I’m glad I didn’t. I got one XY Evolutions, one Unbroken Bonds and one Unified Minds. I can get the latter two at the store. These packs were obviously weighed because the only “nice” ones I got were reverse holos and the rare ones were meh. Of course, you can’t control that, as they’re all random but what can be controlled is the packs being weighed.This is a good deal if you’re buying for children who aren’t serious collectors and just play with them. If you’re buying because you like to collect and enjoy the thrill of a good pull, you’ll get more excitement going to a store and spending a few more dollars for packs that haven’t been weighed so you have a fair chance of pulling holo rares/ultra rares.

    I was suspicious looking at my packs as from the outside they looked as if they were coming undone at the ends, then my final pack sealed the deal.

Whoever opened my pack must have had to replace the card, taken out the rare that was in it, and given me a resealed pack and accidentally put in the code card backwards.Very disappointing... I have yet to open an EvolutionS pack with a rare inside from a 3rd party vendor.

    Should have watched you tube videos and read these reviews.  Several red flags.  Packs didn’t come in cardboard sleeve and the center tab on each pack was separated at both the top and bottom.  That should not happen on new packs.  Definitely seam tampered with and resealed .

    I purchased 5 orders (15 packs) and enjoy them all, but was hoping for more variety.  I ordered from ABCTOY4ME and received the following: 4 packs of EX Hidden Legends, 4 packs of EX Emerald, 7 packs of Diamond & Pearl Legends Awakened.In addition to collecting the cards, our 11 year old boy also collects the foil wrappers which we received duplicates of as well.  In total there were 9 different wrappers among the 15 packs.  It was fun not knowing what we would receive and we will order again, but may try the other vendor selling these in hopes of a more varied selection.  Best of Luck!UPDATED MAY 2, 2012:This past week I ordered 2 more sets (6 packs) from BB Toy Store, and am completely satisfied.  The packaging was better as it was in a box instead of a bubble wrap envelope.  I received the product quicker; most likely because BB Toy Store and I are both on the East Coast whereas ABCTOY4me is on the West Coast.  The packs definately gave me more variety with no duplicates, and I also received a Lvl X card in one of the packs.  I received one of each HS Unleashed, Platinum Supreme Victors, Diamond & Pearl Mysterious Treasures, Black & white, HS Undaunted, and Call of Legends.Each of the vendors clearly sent me different products, and I will most likely order from both of them again in the future.UPDATED MAY 15, 2012:I gave ABCTOY4me another try and purchased 3 more orders (9 packs) and this time received no duplicates.  I received one of each of the following: Diamond & Pearl Legends Awakened, HS Undaunted, Heartgold Soulsilver, Call of Legends, HS Triumphant, Black & White, Ex Hidden Legends, Ex Emerald, and Platinum.  I must note that I am skeptical of the Ex Emerald pack I received.  The paper is very shiny and not the same as the other cards.  The first card in the pack was a rare holo while the last card was upsidedown.  The pack has 9 cards total and 5 were Energy.  Seems strange.The bottom line is that this is completely random and you never know what you'll get, but the price is right.  Give it a try.

    I read all the reviews about how bad these cards were and was a little scared but I ordered two packs anayway. I was a little suspicious that the cards were weighed when I opened both packs and found these booster packs: (2) XY BREAKthrough, (2) XY Ancient Origins, and (2) XY Primal Clash. The only card that actually has high value in the 6 booster packs that I opened is a Raichu BREAK. All the other rare cards were non-holo rares and uncommon reverse holos.The reasons I'm giving it five stars is because: I started collecting Pokemon cards in November of 2015 and I had never opened any Primal Clash booster pack before, I got a break card, and it helped me expand my Ancient Origins, BREAKthough collection, and start my primal clash collection.

    I've bought this product twice, all six packs I've opened I didn't get an EX out of. May be bad luck because I don't think these packs are weighed but still disappointed. Expect two packs from XY, And one from Black And White.
  
"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought ten orders (30 packs total) hoping to get a wide variety of packs as advertised. The package arrived and I got 10 packs of X/Y, B&W, and Flashfire each. I didn't really mind because I did in fact need cards from these sets still. I sat down and opened all 30 packs, and got 1 EX, and about 10 holo rares. Not that great but maybe I was just unlucky.Along with this order I also got a booster box of Flashfire not knowing 10 out of the 30 ""assorted packs"" would be Flashfire. This booster box itself gave me six EXs, two being full art, a hidden rare, and at least six holo rares. Again this could be considered all luck, but still... I also noticed that the ""assorted packs"" were very flimsy in comparison to the brand new booster box packs, and I noticed the cards weren't in the normal order brand new packs are in (one had three non holo rares in it with NO uncommons?).  I don't want to assume they were searched or anything like that... but I will be buying booster boxes only from now on.Again, maybe I was just extremely unlucky with these, but opening 27 packs straight before getting a single super rare card makes me wonder. If you are looking to finish a set and all you need are reverse holos... this is the right product for you.

These may not be the best sets for avid collectors looking for rare cards but a great deal for kids to play and trade with friends.  Will buy again!

    I bought the ""3 Random Packs"" from VGMX and was somewhat disappointed at first. The first time I ordered 3 random packs (probably 4 or so years ago) I got an old fossil pack and two other random packs. I bought again (three orders) about 6 months ago and each order were the same three different packs with some decent pulls. I ordered from VGMX to change it up and what I received was just a blister pack of 3 Ancient Origins packs and a Mega Rayquaza pin. For the money this was definitely worth it but that wasn't what I was hoping for. Out of the three packs I did pull a Full Art Sceptile EX which out of the two booster boxes of the set that I got, I did not have yet. Happy about the pull, happy about the price, but not what I was hoping for. I will buy again from this seller to see if I get something different and also try out other sellers. Will update this when that happens...

    So I ordered this with caution upon seeing some of the other reviews and decided on only one set. ""The Eclectic Shopper"" filled the order. To my surprise they were Black and White: Legendary Treasures, XY and XY:Flashfire boosters packs. I did pull a Full Art Reshiram but otherwise the rest of the rares were non-holos. I'd recommend this to some one who likes grab bags because it's comparable to going to Walmart or Target and just picking three packs. Now if you are trying to complete a set or looking for something specific, I would look else where. But if you are starting out or just want to try your luck, give it a shot.

    So i thought I'd give this lot a try, see if I got any good pulls because it was from random pack and I don't like getting the same cards over and over. I bought 4 lots so 12 packs. Not a single ex or mega, these packs are obviously weighed, I saw other reviews figured I'd still give it a shot. Bad decision, whoever sells these or manages them pulls out the heavier packs for good cards. Don't waste your money.

    This is a great buy if you're looking for something affordable with good quality cards. The cards in these packs have helped me build a deck that is so strong.

"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Do not buy if you want packs that you can't get from target/ Walmart. All packs were from the xy set except one, which was a plasma freeze pack. Not very random in my opinion. If I wanted to get a bunch of flashfire packs I could go and buy them from a store without worrying about whether or not they are weighed prior to being sold. I do not know if that happens here, but I bought 9 packs and did  not even get a holo rare. I could just be unlucky, but something does feel fishy. Definitely will never buy again.

    Well, I figured these were weighted so my expectations were low but I needed a small purchase to push my order over $35 to get same day shipping. I opened these on my Pokemon TCG channel and got all non-holo rares. Could they have been weighted packs? (quite possibly) Or could I have just had bad pull luck? (quite possibly) The world may never know. I received all XY series packs: Ancient Origins, Breakpoint, & Furious Fists. Oh well, only $3/pack; how can I complain? I probably won't purchase again though.

    I purchased 5 of the random 3 packs and was very pleased with the selection. Of the 15 boosters I received only 2 were duplicates. I am a player as well as a collector, so It's nice to be able to get 3 random packs for only a dollar more than the one of the current gen boosters.Anyways, it's a real bargain and I've already placed an order for several more.

    I ordered this believing that it was literally 3 packs from random sets , I received 3 packs of XY flash fires , immediately I put this at a 3 stars but I gave it an extra star because I had really good pulls from the packs , I most likely won't order this again seeing how I already had that set completed. If it had been 3 different sets I'd order them again in a heartbeat.

    I ordered 5 of these 3 random booster pack sets so 15 packs total. I ordered 2 from all star games and 3 from another carrier for variety. Only got the newer and less valued X&Y packs, only pulled ONE ultra rare from 15 packs. And the ultra rare was from the first 6 packs so the second carrier weighed their packs. Very disappointed. Not buying anything from Amazon again.

    For starting from scratch on collecting, the pulls were eh. 2 Fates Collide and 1 Evolutions pack. 2 regular rares and one mega EX card out of the Evolutions pack. Cool to get my first mega ex but was hoping the other two packs would have better pulls (but hey it's a gamble). 3 packs for $10 instead of $14ish from Walmart seems like a good deal. Cards were 100% real although packaging of the booster packs may have seemed like they were repackaged. I'd probably buy from the seller again if I didn't find any better deals

    This was terrible! I bought 5 of these with a total of 15 packs! Packs included were 5 phantom forces, 5 roaring skies, 4 primal clash, & 1 ancient origin pack! So not much of it being so random! & I didn't receive one ultra rare or holographic card! I figure these packs were weighed, cuz the odds of pulling a holo, or ultra ex should be higher! I will not be buying again, and will look elsewhere in the future! Hope this helps others choices!

    Packs were weighed. When received, I reweighed them and they were all very light. Upon opening them, all three packs contained reverse holos and normal rares. These are the lightest possible packs. After receiving three packs that have the same weight that contain the same rarity of cards, it is clear that nothing is random about these packs at all.If I were a normal buyer, I would be upset. Luckily, I only purchased these to get up to my 35 dollar free one day shipping point with Amazon Prime. This is a very bad deal. I suspect the nicer reviews are staged. It would be pretty odd for me to ""randomly"" receive the shortest possible end of the stick. On top of that, two of my packs were the exact same, pack-art wise. And none of them were from anything more than a year old.
  
"

    Pretty disappointed in the fact that I see all these reviews on some of the cards are fake and not in the correct order when opening. I can't help but to share my experience with the 6 packs i got. I actually received 0 rare holos out of 6 packs. Doesn't sound like bad luck to me. Go buy them yourself at a store.

    There wasn't anything random about these packs. I purchased 15 booster packs in all.A.

Will not be ordering again. If i wanted 15 of the same I would not have purchased it from someone advertising ""random packs""

    Came quickly and as described. Was a bit apprehensive due to you never knowing if the packs are weighed , but no evidence was shown of weighing. I pulled a bricks grit full art from an evolutions pack with the other two having one rare reverse and a rare holo. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I got two evolutions packs and one ancient origins. Would recommend however to anyone looking for cards at a reasonable price.

    First of all, the shipping is always insanely fast.  I have bought many of these packs and I must say that they are MOST DEFINITELY not searched or weighed at all.

    I just bought 3 random booster packs, and the description is correct, but in a way not really. You do get 3 booster packs, BUT THEY ARE NOT RANDOM, LISTEN: the people sending these booster packs weigh them, they buy a whole bunch of booster packs and weigh each pack because the booster packs with rare holos weigh slightly more (look this up online). They then take the booster packs with lower weights (that dont have ultra rares) and sell them online. You will most likely get lame cards that aren't rare holos. DO NOT BUY, this is a form of scamming. You are not getting ""random booster packs"", you are getting carefully hand selected booster packs that will most likely not have any rare holos. The price may seem good, but trust me, this is not worth it. Go to walmart or target to buy pokemon cards, because online, sellers will scam you.
