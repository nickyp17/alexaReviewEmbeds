    I simply bought these for my 6 yr old grandson. He picked them out.  He's not into having expensive cards but simply likes to collect.  He's quite happy with them.

    Packaging was very sus and looked to be resealed. I got 6 packs and got 2 halo and a umbreon vmax. Packaging could be factory mistake as why packs are only 5$ each which is very fair. Def worth the buy. Seller was Luigi Cards. 10/10

    I haven't opened Any of my packs yet. There are signs of them being  Re sealed. Pictures don't do justice. The packs themselves feel loose and not normal, You can clearly see where it has been opened and re sealed. The markings of the re seals, melt marks.  Etc.

    The top and bottom lines of the packs are both uneven ( on all three packs) , one of them had glue residues on the exterior of the seal and this one alongside another one had glue residue on the inside of the seal. The pulls weren’t absolutely terrible but weren’t great either and i did get one holo per pack but that stops there. Wouldn’t recommend. Very disappointed.

    Of course you won't get the packs shown because as time passes they'll cycle in the newer cheaper packs. I managed to pull a full art trainer out of a chilling reign booster. However, one of the boosters seemed to be missing a code card... that same pack had a non-holo rare in it.... do with that information what you will. (I'm only leaving 3 stars because of it.)

    First and foremost, this was purchased from K STAMPS, so I'm referring to my experiences with products from them. Nothing else.I ordered one set of 3 packs and received the following: Roaring Skies, Primal Clash and Darkness Ablaze. The primal clash was the pack I felt was resealed, so I decided to take a closer look at all the cards I got after opening it. One of the cards, a Treecko, stuck out because while the other cards in the pack were dated 2015, the Treecko was dated 2014. I'm not saying it's fake, because I know there were prints of Treecko in 2014, but it's not normal to get cards of different years in the same pack. Add to that the slit I found at the top of the pack, and it looks suspicious. The other packs looked fine and I did get a decent pull, but that one pack was definitely tampered with.I contacted K STAMPS, and they assured me that they don't tamper with the cards at all. They stated they actually send the envelopes of 3 packs each to amazon in bulk, which explains why they are fulfilled by amazon. However, the envelope I got was sealed and didn't look damaged at all or like it had been opened before. So, is it K STAMPS or Amazon workers tampering with these cards? At this point, it could be either as I honestly have no clue.TL:DR: One of the packs was resealed, and I'm upset.

    Fraudulent items. These cards have very clearly been opened and resealed. The card backs differ in colour within one pack, some cards have scratches on them and the print dates on the cards differ within one pack. One pack felt bumpy - poor reseal job, the other two had fairly large unsealed corners. It was hard to get good pictures, but it's very obvious in person - especially the colour differences and the scratches. Brutal.

He’s just starting to collect Pokémon cards & was beyond pleased with the 3 packages he received!Just because of some bad reviews, we had a friend (a long-time Pokémon card collector) check over the cards & packaging to ensure that we were getting what we had paid for. The cards & packaging we received are brand new, not resealed, and authentic.I am also pleased with the customer service I received after purchasing. The seller responded quickly and was very friendly & accommodating.I will be purchasing more cards from this seller in the future

    I read many reviews warning that these had been resealed packs. But then some reviews had indicated that they got great pulls and all were factory sealed. So I took a chance and only ordered 3 packs. So this review is based on a small sample size.All the reviews indicating that these are resealed are fact. This company clearly goes to great efforts to reseal them as to the naked eye one probably can't tell. But anyone who knows what to look for can easily tell. And these were certainly resealed. I was disappointed before I had even opened the packs.Once I opened them, the clear indicator was that the card counts were off. A booster pack consists of 10 randomly sorted cards  and guaranteed to have 6 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare. Each blister will also have at least 1 foil card.What did I get?4 - rares11 - Uncommons15 commons3 of these cards were foil cards.At first glance you immediately think that this is a great pull as I got 1 additional rare and 2 additional uncommon. You are right, based on pure rarity counts, it's a good pull. But not everything is treated equal. And the fact the counts are off is your proof that they have been tampered with. And despite the additional rarities, every card was mediocre at best with little to no value.A card and collectibles store in my area sells blister packs(opened) for 5$ a pop. The key difference here is that they TELL you they have been opened and they TELL you that you won't get anything other than standard rares. But that is why they only charge 5$. And the pulls you would expect is exactly what you would are probably going to get from this company.I can't say DONT buy them. Just buyer beware. These have been resealed. Might be a good gift at a cheaper price for young kids getting into Pokemon. Collectors should absolutely look elsewhere.Hopefully this review was helpful.

    1 out of 6 packs had an ok card. Bought more from a reputable dealer in town and it was a completely different experience. These packs are 100% weighed opened and resealed I have no idea how amazon can allow the sale of this stuff. There isnt a single pokemon dealer on here that isnt rated horribly for resealing. Disgusting.

    The packs are clearly not reseated and are official, usually get good pulls when I order this product, but the false advertising is a let down. It is advertised in the photo that this includes three random X/Y series packs, nowhere does it say that you are getting modern packs even though I have payed for what was advertised. Either change how this product is presented or follow up on your promise. I have ordered this item many times, and not once have I ever even seen a single Sun/Moon or X/Y pack, even though that is what I payed for. Please make up for this in some way. False advertising is not cool.

    A very good selection of packs. Ordered 5 times so far and have always got more than my moneys worth when compared to other sellers on here and online auction sites.I am a Pokemon collector and can confirm that none of the packs i received had been tampered with.As with being weighed i would say that they haven't due to me getting some ultra rare pulls but you can never be certain with loose packs.This is just my opinion from the 15 packs i have had so far from this seller. I have ordered other packs from Kstamps and never had any problems and will be ordering more.

    11 cards per pack, clearly states 10 on packaging.Comparison picture to that of some packs bought at Asda. Top row is Asda, bottom these booster packs…. 3vs3 packs I find it hard to believe.Sure luck is always to account for when opening these, but with the blatant resealing (poor glue, lines not matching and of course as above 11 cards).Do yourself a favour save your money unless you’re just starting out, even then money is better spent on legit packs!

    My 7-year old purchased three packs from his hard earned chore money after reading the description and anticipating at least some valuable cards. He cried in utter disappointment after waiting two weeks for them to arrive (we are military overseas) saying: “They are all weak Pokémon.” There were no EX in either of the packs nor any other special Pokémon. I know that there is no guarantee but seeing your child cry and asking if he can get his money back was heartbreaking. I’d suggest changing the description of the product.

    Pokemon cards are really only good value for money because they cause such joy for the child collector who receives them, which is priceless. I do think they are too expensive, as a small pack is £4 where I live with only a few cards in the pack and so many cards are needed for a good collection.

    I don't know if I should be mad or happy. So i purchased these just simply thinking it was a good deal. Like many who have posted on here I too experienced some tampering with the product. One of the packs there wasn't even an energy card, not really complaining because over the years of collecting I have enough energy cards lol. However, All packs come with at least one energy card unless you get a holo energy. That same pack I got 3 rare cards. Am I upset about that? Not at all. However I can tell that some one also probably weighted 2 of the packs to guarantee I would not get a rare holo like one post on here. I probably won't buy from here again. Due to the sketchy things going on. I've learned from this mistake.  I did get some cards I needed but on the other hand I would have preferred to get an honest pack than a tampered one.

    Well, I figured for $10, I'd take a chance and see what I got. Not knowing which cards or pack you'll get is half the fun anyway. I wasn't hoping for much card wise, but I was at least hoping to get something as far back as Black/White. I got two packs of XY Roaring Skies and one of XY Primal Clash - both of which I could've bought at the nearest toy store, so that was kinda disappointing. Out of them, the only thing of worth was a reverse rare Banette. So, I can't say if they're weighted or not. It might just be I had bad pulling luck. Might give them the benefit of the doubt and try again at a later date.3/16/16 - I decided to give these sellers another try. Since I've been collecting, I've gotten into collecting the coins and pins you can find in some boosters and packs. So this time I purchased (2) Three Random Booster Packs from VGMX, which stated I would get an extra coin and promo/holofoil card. Foolishly, I assumed that it would be three random packs, a coin and a promo from varying sets or previous boosters or whatever that had already been opened and distributed for sale. What I got was legitimately 2 blisters, resulting in all of my ""random"" packs being Breakthrough. Seeing as it would likely cost me half as much to send the packages back as paying for them, I decided to just accept the fact that they weren't random and opened them to see what I got. I got two reverse rares out of the packs, aside from the holo promos that came with the blisters. Something seemed fishy, but I figured that you can't really weight boosters, right?3/30/16 - Wanting to solve the mystery once and for all, I purchased a gram scale so that I could weight the packs I buy from different stores and sellers, to see which places were the safest to buy cards. I decided to give this ONE LAST shot. So I bought 3 packs of Three Random Boosters, nine packs total, from Swift Buy. They arrived today and, honestly, I'm surprised that I was as hopeful as I was. But when I opened it and saw that my ""random"" boosters were in packs of three, resulting in three packs of 2 XY Base Set and 1 Flashfire almost with the exact same art too, I knew I was screwed. Still, I wanted to be dutiful and weighed each pack. It is as follows:X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.5 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 gramsX/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.3 gramsX/Y Base w/ Blastoise Art = 18.5 gramsX/Y Base w/ Venosaur Art = 18.4 gramsFlashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.8 gramsFlashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.7 gramsFlashfire w/ Pyroar art = 19.7 gramsNeedless to say, after seeing those numbers, I was upset. So I opened them all and with EVERY SINGLE NON HOLO RARE I got, I just got more livid. The whole reason I bought nine was because I wanted to rule out any chance of my having just rotten pulling luck. With Pokémon cards, you are expected to get one EX/Ultra rare every 4 packs, MAYBE five if you have a bad day. But nine packs in one sitting with absolutely nothing to show for it? Statistically, it simply doesn't add up. Further, if you add my other two previous purchases, that's 18 BOOSTERS WITH NOTHING!Now, I'm willing to concede that the first time I bought from Swift Buy (when all I got was the reverse rare Banette), I just had bad pulling luck. And while it IS hard to weight boosters, it IS possible. But I chose to give VGMX the benefit of the doubt. But having bought 9 packs (for a total of 12) from Swift Buy with nothing but non-holo rares to show for it, I can - with complete confidence - tell you that there is absolutely nothing random about these packs. They clearly pull the best packs and then resell the duds to unsuspecting online buyers, probably in the hopes that an unsuspecting parent or grandparent buys them for their kids and will never bother to submit a complaint to Amazon.Well, Swift Buy, you aren't fooling me.DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! And only buy from VGMX if you're looking for pin-free blisters. My suggestion to you is to save your money and buy at your local stores. Either that, or go to eBay. That's where I'll be from now on.

    Previously I thought I was scammed from my items, but a few days ago I received them (originally was supposed to receive them on the 23 of February). For some reason they were all sent in three separate envelopes, two showing on the same day, one on another day. I got all three of them as sun and moon booster packs. Only one I had my suspicions of being tampered, but the other two seem fine. While I did end up getting my items, I had no means of communicating with the seller and had no means of refunding when I thought I was ripped off. I did only pay for 10+, but its still something consumers should be wary of. I would recommend purchasing elsewhere, but take caution when purchasing.

    all three packs were like the worst kind of dud packs, nothing in them,  one didn't even have a rare or a foil. like I said, dud packs.  I’m not accusing this seller however Pokémon cards are easily weighed out on a hand held scale revealing which ones will have a “hit” or not. These packs we received may have been the worst three packs we have ever opened.  I would caution anyone who is buying these to think about this before you spend all you kids gift cards on these three dud packs.

    Truth be told you are Gambling . You may or may not end up with tampered card packs. My cards were legit upon opening, very few duplicates,  cards in nice condition,  all the usual signs of a legit booster such as at least one rare, reverse holo, 11 cards. That's right! 11 cards. I know it says 10 cards,  goto the store , buy a pack, open it and count the cards. That aside I still feel my boosters were tampered with some areas as you can see in the photo seemed glues down where the shouldn't be, like the picture showcasing the back flap. Probably not the sellers fault as they were probably returned resealed.  Just nothing worth while out of 6 booster packs. Each pack had a rare card, but only 1 was holo. I always buy from the store at least three packs, and always have something NICE. Congrats to those who ordered and Got Exactly what they payed for and had something Great in them 😃! I'll be sticking to in store purchases until Amazon finds a way to Verify booster packs returns. Thanks for reading 📚.

I anticipated that the offering was similar to others of this type - where packs of recent overstocks are sent - but received 3 Fusion Strike packs, which have recently depreciated in value. I expected there to be some variation of modern packs. It's still a good deal, but I would purchase another lot if looking for a wider spread of sets. I took a chance on it because even though Steam Siege and Rebel Clash are less popular sets, they are ""old"" yet modern enough to maybe get thrown in. Good deal, but not for serious collectors.

    The packs are just the most recent packs. It's not actually ""random,"" it's just the most recent releases. My packs were 2 Fusion Strike and 1 Chilling Reign for a grand total of $15, which I could have gotten at Best Buy down my street for less. Not totally unhappy, as I did get a decent pull from one, but overall I would say I wasted my money.

    Packs you’ll get will probably be bad, definitely not any XY like in pics, i got 2 battle styles and 1 sun and moon, basically just overpaid for packs i just bought last week at a Walgreens i drove up to. Battle styles blisters have been sitting on shelves around here until there’s nothing better left. Packs just had crap reverse holos and no good pulls. If it’s all random then i must have bad luck, let’s hope it’s that and not weighing crappy packs to sell them off in groups of 3 lights.

    I dint understand some of the negative reviews about not getting a rare when the cards are obviously randomized. Please be aware that when you are buying these cards for kids or yourself that no rare holo or EX is garunteed. I myself have found two in one pack and can send a picture to prove it. I have already ordered multiple packs from this seller with a few more on the way (god I need help lol) but I can vouch that they are legitimate and sell quality and authentic products. I have tried the Pokémon TCG codes in the packs and they work.

    3 packs of chilling reign every time.The good reviews seem to be from people who don’t know much about the hobby.Packs are not sold loose like this unless you’re buying at a store that uses the full booster box as a display. Loose packs like these are usually weighed and separated so the seller has all the good cards.I’ve ordered this a few times over the span of a couple months to test a theory. All packs I’ve received weigh just about the same. All packs have been green code cards and no holo.Anyone can say what they want though, people will still buy these. Just know that it’s a carnival game you’re not going to win.

    My packs arrived in a larger envelope and inside they were sealed in separate bubble mailers with three packs In each. All of the packs were from CR, BS, and FS. I bought 10 so a total of 30 packs, in the first 15 I pulled two secret rares  and one VMAX. Overall I’m already happy with the purchase even if the rest of the packs are cold, and yes the cards are legit, def not fake

    This product is highly misleading. The product image is painfully out of date. If you're looking for some older packs and clicked this thinking you could find something unusual - don't.  The packs I got were Battle Styles, Chilling Reign and Fusion Strike. All very recent packs and nothing unusual at all. I can't confirm or deny the other people claiming the packs are resealed though.Pokemon has released 3-pack blisters for many years. This listing suggests a random one. What you get are 3 loose packs unprofessionally chucked in a bag. Which for the price is... fine. But this whole thing is misleading. They should be more clear that this is for 3, loose, random packs of whatever is in print.

    I bought 4 of these 3 packs a day or two after Christmas.  I received 4 wrapped chilling reign sandwiches with battle styles buns lol (2 battle styles and 1 chilling reign pack per 3).  I wouldn't say it was very random but at least they weren't all the same. Shipping arrived fairly quickly and I'm generally happy with this purchase.As with all cards, packs are a gamble of sorts and you never know what you're going to get.  These packs did not seem resealed to me, the back flap was not fully sealed to the top of the pack on some but I've also experienced boosters from the store like that as well so I did not dwell on it and opened to see what was inside.Overall an average pull rate in my opinion, I pulled 6 & 6 green and green/white code cards.  Actual card pulls revealed a secret rare gold Octillery and a Single Strike Urshifu VMAX, as well as a few holo rares.Before I purchased this product I checked the reviews for the SELLER.  Nearly 100% satisfaction in the last year so I decided to risk purchasing despite some poor reviews on the listing itself.  If you are thinking about buying, make an educated decision so you aren't disappointed with a bad one.  Hope this helps!

    My kid worked around the house to make enough to buy these booster packets. When I got them I looked them over to make sure they were untampered with, since it happens a lot. These were most definitely resealed. The pictures may not have the details to see what you can see in person but it is very noticeable. The ends of the packs were re-crimped and the ends didn’t match up/uneven. When opened, the glued sides stuck to each other and made it more obvious they were resealed.

    I bought 10 of these 3 booster pack sets  based on the pictures assuming that I would get a bunch of different boosters but I ended up getting 20 Astral Radiance and 10 Chilling Reign.Technically the buyer is indeed providing exactly what the listing says but I wish they wouldn’t use pics of old boosters because it gives a false impression that it’s possible to get non Sw/Sh boosters when in reality it’s not.Now that I am aware of that I can just go on EBay and pay $2.50 per booster and save $5.Bummer. This could have been really cool if it was what I thought it was based on the pictures.

    The best experience I have had getting pokemon cards. 10 cards per pack right to my door. Sealed beautifully in ready to go packages that I can use later on. 30 cards is perfect for a small video. 90 cards (3 of these purchases) for two guests is great for a long video or a stream. 3 different card generations helps to keep things interesting and ensure we never run out of Pokemon topics to talk about between the generations.  I will for sure be looking for this again down the road.

    It’s a hit or miss with Pokémon cards but painful when kids look at the pictures in description/advertisement of this seller and think they’ll get at least few good cards. We only got 1 decent card and many energy type cards.

    I bought these for kicks because of the good deal and even considered opening these on camera but I’m glad I didn’t. I got one XY Evolutions, one Unbroken Bonds and one Unified Minds. I can get the latter two at the store. These packs were obviously weighed because the only “nice” ones I got were reverse holos and the rare ones were meh. Of course, you can’t control that, as they’re all random but what can be controlled is the packs being weighed.This is a good deal if you’re buying for children who aren’t serious collectors and just play with them. If you’re buying because you like to collect and enjoy the thrill of a good pull, you’ll get more excitement going to a store and spending a few more dollars for packs that haven’t been weighed so you have a fair chance of pulling holo rares/ultra rares.

    I was suspicious looking at my packs as from the outside they looked as if they were coming undone at the ends, then my final pack sealed the deal.

Whoever opened my pack must have had to replace the card, taken out the rare that was in it, and given me a resealed pack and accidentally put in the code card backwards.Very disappointing... I have yet to open an EvolutionS pack with a rare inside from a 3rd party vendor.

    Should have watched you tube videos and read these reviews.  Several red flags.  Packs didn’t come in cardboard sleeve and the center tab on each pack was separated at both the top and bottom.  That should not happen on new packs.  Definitely seam tampered with and resealed .

    I purchased 5 orders (15 packs) and enjoy them all, but was hoping for more variety.  I ordered from ABCTOY4ME and received the following: 4 packs of EX Hidden Legends, 4 packs of EX Emerald, 7 packs of Diamond & Pearl Legends Awakened.In addition to collecting the cards, our 11 year old boy also collects the foil wrappers which we received duplicates of as well.  In total there were 9 different wrappers among the 15 packs.  It was fun not knowing what we would receive and we will order again, but may try the other vendor selling these in hopes of a more varied selection.  Best of Luck!UPDATED MAY 2, 2012:This past week I ordered 2 more sets (6 packs) from BB Toy Store, and am completely satisfied.  The packaging was better as it was in a box instead of a bubble wrap envelope.  I received the product quicker; most likely because BB Toy Store and I are both on the East Coast whereas ABCTOY4me is on the West Coast.  The packs definately gave me more variety with no duplicates, and I also received a Lvl X card in one of the packs.  I received one of each HS Unleashed, Platinum Supreme Victors, Diamond & Pearl Mysterious Treasures, Black & white, HS Undaunted, and Call of Legends.Each of the vendors clearly sent me different products, and I will most likely order from both of them again in the future.UPDATED MAY 15, 2012:I gave ABCTOY4me another try and purchased 3 more orders (9 packs) and this time received no duplicates.  I received one of each of the following: Diamond & Pearl Legends Awakened, HS Undaunted, Heartgold Soulsilver, Call of Legends, HS Triumphant, Black & White, Ex Hidden Legends, Ex Emerald, and Platinum.  I must note that I am skeptical of the Ex Emerald pack I received.  The paper is very shiny and not the same as the other cards.  The first card in the pack was a rare holo while the last card was upsidedown.  The pack has 9 cards total and 5 were Energy.  Seems strange.The bottom line is that this is completely random and you never know what you'll get, but the price is right.  Give it a try.

    I read all the reviews about how bad these cards were and was a little scared but I ordered two packs anayway. I was a little suspicious that the cards were weighed when I opened both packs and found these booster packs: (2) XY BREAKthrough, (2) XY Ancient Origins, and (2) XY Primal Clash. The only card that actually has high value in the 6 booster packs that I opened is a Raichu BREAK. All the other rare cards were non-holo rares and uncommon reverse holos.The reasons I'm giving it five stars is because: I started collecting Pokemon cards in November of 2015 and I had never opened any Primal Clash booster pack before, I got a break card, and it helped me expand my Ancient Origins, BREAKthough collection, and start my primal clash collection.

    I've bought this product twice, all six packs I've opened I didn't get an EX out of. May be bad luck because I don't think these packs are weighed but still disappointed. Expect two packs from XY, And one from Black And White.
  
"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought ten orders (30 packs total) hoping to get a wide variety of packs as advertised. The package arrived and I got 10 packs of X/Y, B&W, and Flashfire each. I didn't really mind because I did in fact need cards from these sets still. I sat down and opened all 30 packs, and got 1 EX, and about 10 holo rares. Not that great but maybe I was just unlucky.Along with this order I also got a booster box of Flashfire not knowing 10 out of the 30 ""assorted packs"" would be Flashfire. This booster box itself gave me six EXs, two being full art, a hidden rare, and at least six holo rares. Again this could be considered all luck, but still... I also noticed that the ""assorted packs"" were very flimsy in comparison to the brand new booster box packs, and I noticed the cards weren't in the normal order brand new packs are in (one had three non holo rares in it with NO uncommons?).  I don't want to assume they were searched or anything like that... but I will be buying booster boxes only from now on.Again, maybe I was just extremely unlucky with these, but opening 27 packs straight before getting a single super rare card makes me wonder. If you are looking to finish a set and all you need are reverse holos... this is the right product for you.

These may not be the best sets for avid collectors looking for rare cards but a great deal for kids to play and trade with friends.  Will buy again!

    I bought the ""3 Random Packs"" from VGMX and was somewhat disappointed at first. The first time I ordered 3 random packs (probably 4 or so years ago) I got an old fossil pack and two other random packs. I bought again (three orders) about 6 months ago and each order were the same three different packs with some decent pulls. I ordered from VGMX to change it up and what I received was just a blister pack of 3 Ancient Origins packs and a Mega Rayquaza pin. For the money this was definitely worth it but that wasn't what I was hoping for. Out of the three packs I did pull a Full Art Sceptile EX which out of the two booster boxes of the set that I got, I did not have yet. Happy about the pull, happy about the price, but not what I was hoping for. I will buy again from this seller to see if I get something different and also try out other sellers. Will update this when that happens...

    So I ordered this with caution upon seeing some of the other reviews and decided on only one set. ""The Eclectic Shopper"" filled the order. To my surprise they were Black and White: Legendary Treasures, XY and XY:Flashfire boosters packs. I did pull a Full Art Reshiram but otherwise the rest of the rares were non-holos. I'd recommend this to some one who likes grab bags because it's comparable to going to Walmart or Target and just picking three packs. Now if you are trying to complete a set or looking for something specific, I would look else where. But if you are starting out or just want to try your luck, give it a shot.

    So i thought I'd give this lot a try, see if I got any good pulls because it was from random pack and I don't like getting the same cards over and over. I bought 4 lots so 12 packs. Not a single ex or mega, these packs are obviously weighed, I saw other reviews figured I'd still give it a shot. Bad decision, whoever sells these or manages them pulls out the heavier packs for good cards. Don't waste your money.

    This is a great buy if you're looking for something affordable with good quality cards. The cards in these packs have helped me build a deck that is so strong.

"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Do not buy if you want packs that you can't get from target/ Walmart. All packs were from the xy set except one, which was a plasma freeze pack. Not very random in my opinion. If I wanted to get a bunch of flashfire packs I could go and buy them from a store without worrying about whether or not they are weighed prior to being sold. I do not know if that happens here, but I bought 9 packs and did  not even get a holo rare. I could just be unlucky, but something does feel fishy. Definitely will never buy again.

    Well, I figured these were weighted so my expectations were low but I needed a small purchase to push my order over $35 to get same day shipping. I opened these on my Pokemon TCG channel and got all non-holo rares. Could they have been weighted packs? (quite possibly) Or could I have just had bad pull luck? (quite possibly) The world may never know. I received all XY series packs: Ancient Origins, Breakpoint, & Furious Fists. Oh well, only $3/pack; how can I complain? I probably won't purchase again though.

    I purchased 5 of the random 3 packs and was very pleased with the selection. Of the 15 boosters I received only 2 were duplicates. I am a player as well as a collector, so It's nice to be able to get 3 random packs for only a dollar more than the one of the current gen boosters.Anyways, it's a real bargain and I've already placed an order for several more.

    I ordered this believing that it was literally 3 packs from random sets , I received 3 packs of XY flash fires , immediately I put this at a 3 stars but I gave it an extra star because I had really good pulls from the packs , I most likely won't order this again seeing how I already had that set completed. If it had been 3 different sets I'd order them again in a heartbeat.

    I ordered 5 of these 3 random booster pack sets so 15 packs total. I ordered 2 from all star games and 3 from another carrier for variety. Only got the newer and less valued X&Y packs, only pulled ONE ultra rare from 15 packs. And the ultra rare was from the first 6 packs so the second carrier weighed their packs. Very disappointed.

    For starting from scratch on collecting, the pulls were eh. 2 Fates Collide and 1 Evolutions pack. 2 regular rares and one mega EX card out of the Evolutions pack. Cool to get my first mega ex but was hoping the other two packs would have better pulls (but hey it's a gamble). 3 packs for $10 instead of $14ish from Walmart seems like a good deal. Cards were 100% real although packaging of the booster packs may have seemed like they were repackaged. I'd probably buy from the seller again if I didn't find any better deals

So not much of it being so random! & I didn't receive one ultra rare or holographic card! I figure these packs were weighed, cuz the odds of pulling a holo, or ultra ex should be higher! I will not be buying again, and will look elsewhere in the future! Hope this helps others choices!

    Packs were weighed. When received, I reweighed them and they were all very light. Upon opening them, all three packs contained reverse holos and normal rares. These are the lightest possible packs. After receiving three packs that have the same weight that contain the same rarity of cards, it is clear that nothing is random about these packs at all.If I were a normal buyer, I would be upset. Luckily, I only purchased these to get up to my 35 dollar free one day shipping point with Amazon Prime. This is a very bad deal. I suspect the nicer reviews are staged. It would be pretty odd for me to ""randomly"" receive the shortest possible end of the stick. On top of that, two of my packs were the exact same, pack-art wise. And none of them were from anything more than a year old.
  
"

    Pretty disappointed in the fact that I see all these reviews on some of the cards are fake and not in the correct order when opening. I can't help but to share my experience with the 6 packs i got. I actually received 0 rare holos out of 6 packs. Doesn't sound like bad luck to me. Go buy them yourself at a store.

    Came quickly and as described. Was a bit apprehensive due to you never knowing if the packs are weighed , but no evidence was shown of weighing. I pulled a bricks grit full art from an evolutions pack with the other two having one rare reverse and a rare holo. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I got two evolutions packs and one ancient origins. Would recommend however to anyone looking for cards at a reasonable price.

    I just bought 3 random booster packs, and the description is correct, but in a way not really. You do get 3 booster packs, BUT THEY ARE NOT RANDOM, LISTEN: the people sending these booster packs weigh them, they buy a whole bunch of booster packs and weigh each pack because the booster packs with rare holos weigh slightly more (look this up online). They then take the booster packs with lower weights (that dont have ultra rares) and sell them online. You will most likely get lame cards that aren't rare holos. DO NOT BUY, this is a form of scamming. You are not getting ""random booster packs"", you are getting carefully hand selected booster packs that will most likely not have any rare holos. The price may seem good, but trust me, this is not worth it. Go to walmart or target to buy pokemon cards, because online, sellers will scam you.

    I do not recommend this style of diaper.  They are very hard to get on the baby and less absorbent. You may also need to consider to size up as my daughter is size 4 in the regular style but size 4 in this style seem to fit a lot tighter.

    I used the size 3 for my 10 month baby, he developed severe rashes after just a few days of use. I have been using swaddlers since his birth, never had any issue. We switched to this because of the ease of putting it on and taking it off. Just after a few days of using this, my baby started becoming very fussy at the time of diaper change. Then he was very itchy near his genitals. We went to the dr. who diagnosed it as a severe rash. I wouldn’t recommend this to another parent ever.

J'ai changé pampers 360 et très satisfaite,  elles sont hyper douce, soyeuse confortable aucun débordement en plus d'avoir la petite languette pour fermer la couche sale ! gros plus!!

    Ce modèle, c'est pas pratique d'être obligé de déchirer la couche lorsqu'il y a une selle... pire si elle est molle. Et plus difficile de remettre la couche. Je vais changer de marque pour des couches standards. J'aime beaucoup mieux les anciennes couches avec rabats sur les côtés. Et à 9 mois, il est trop tôt pour la propreté alors pas besoin de couche-culotte.

    These diapers are awful. The elastic is way too stretchy so every bit of pee just weighs it down and it gets incredibly saggy within a few pees. With the sag, it left rashes on the inside of my daughters thighs. This picture is as the rash was finally healing. It was fire red a few days ago. I will never buy these again. I also don’t find them near absorbent as regular diapers.

    Our 2-year old loves these. We are not read for potty training yet, but our toddler is, so these are perfect for her to sit on a potty any time she wants. She actually changes her own diapers and gets dress, they are easy to remove when there is a poop inside, I just wish it had better tape for closing diaper before disposal, it's a bit of a mess with current system.

    My baby does not lay down for diaper changes, its always a struggle to get the diaper with the tabs on properly. I even had to master the art of 'changing a baby while they walk/crawl around', it was nuts. No one could change the kid except me! Very frustrating, but not anymore! These bad boys slip on and baby is off and running within seconds. I don't have to worry about leaks or blow outs since they have great coverage all around and the sides tearing off for easy disposable is key. I'm super happy with these diapers and wish I'd known about them sooner.

    These are pretty good diapers. Easy to put on, stays on without coming off when baby moves. My baby has a small waist, so I was doubtful if these would stay tight. They did! I don't like scented diapers much, so the scent this diaper has was a put off. But not to the extent that I won't buy these again!! Lol

    These diapers are amazing for our little mover. Diaper changes are a lot less stressful now that we can just slip them on. There are obvious difficulties with applying diaper cream but you just need to find a different way that works for you. The scent of the diapers is pretty strong, I find all Pampers diapers are like that. Definitely no strong pee smell though when they are full. Would strongly recommend these diapers to anyone with a baby that will not stay still for diaper changes!

    I normally love all pamper products but not these. They did not fit my daughter well, she’s got a big bum and little waist and they were so awkward and gapped in weird places but didn’t have enough room for her bum. If your kiddo has big hips and a little bum then they would probably work. I was super disappointed in these and super bummed I decided to try them at all.

    My wiggly baby refuses to lie down unless she's fast asleep, so these are a life saver.  They go on easily, fit like a dream, and seem to be quite absorbent - we're half way through the box and haven't had any leaks yet.  My only argument against these is the scent.  I do not for the life of me understand why Pampers insists on scenting their diapers.  Thankfully my baby doesn't seem to be allergic to it but I've heard of lots of kids who are, so keep that in mind.  Once my kid is big enough for size 4s we'll likely switch to the Huggies version since they don't pump their stuff full of perfumes - we only bought the Pampers ones because they start at size 3, unlike the Huggies.

    I like it that it was scented, i like the design. Its also absorbent. But i don’t like that it was so big. It keeps on falling off my baby especially if it is a bit full but not much( it was like she only peed 2 times then it starts falling off her), she cannot enjoy her time by pulling up again and again.. My baby is using easy ups size 6 but falling off is not a problem to her. Also when i tried to compare the easy ups size 6 and cruisers 360 size 6 its really way too big.

    J'ai achetée ces couches pour mon fils de un an car il y avait toujours des fuites la nuit. Je n'ai plus eu de dégâts dans le lit, ni de pijama souillé depuis que je les utilise ! Hyper absorbantes ! J'adore ! En plus, elles semblent très confortables, pas trop serrées, pas de marques sur la peau, juste parfaites !

    Our baby is extremely fussy when it comes to diaper changes and extremely mobile. This kid screams and rolls as soon as she hits the change pad, so we decided to try these diapers. Huge improvement! Obviously still not a fan of diaper changes, but for wet diapers we can use these for standing/walking/crawling/squirming changes with a lot more ease!  For poopy diapers we still have to lay her down to clean her up, but at least there's some relief. It's difficult to find other pull up style diapers in a size 3 so this has been a reliable choice. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the scent - is that really necessary?

    We will permanently switch to Pampers over Huggies because they fit better for our 2 yr old.  The elastic waist is more comfortable for our child.  He won't be trying to get us to change his diaper because the Huggies pull-ups are hard and uncomfortable.
  
"
"







  
  
    We usually use Huggies little movers but decided to try these because of the pull up design. My issue with them is that they get quite full and heavy after a couple pees. Definitely bulk up more than the Huggies. My husband literally says it feels like there's a chicken breast in the diaper. I think they are better than the pull ups but wouldn't use them in place of normal diaper.

    These diapers are so great for those kids who never stop moving because they have a 360° stretchy waistband that flexes with your kids movements. My son is constantly climbing and what we were using wasn't working anymore. I am so glad to have found these, they are super soft and he seems to be very comfortable in them. You can also say goodbye to blow outs with these diapers that are a pull-up style for easy and quick changes. They have a tape tab on the back so you can easily wrap up the diaper to throw out. I definitely recommend these diapers and will continue to use!

    We tried many pull up style diapers after my daughter decided that laying down for a diaper change is not happening, and these won. They're the most comfortable, don't pinch or bunch up, have a decent bum coverage and they never leaked. Not once, even overnight.
  
"
"







  
  
    We bought these diapers by mistake and wow what a mistake that was. The pull up style is good in theory but you have to fully undress your child to put them on. Meaning if they have pants and socks that you would typically leave around their ankles you can’t, it sounds silly but trying to do a quick diaper change or one in winter with lots of layers is impossible.The BIGGEST problem I have with these is the outside tape, first off good for pretty much an empty diaper as it barely fits around it. Good luck if you had any sort of mess too. Second is the tape on the outside rips open the diaper genie bags because it gets stuck and pulls and more get added. These are awful and just totally impractical, good in theory but terrible in practice.

    My son can barley sit still for a diaper change and the Velcro tabs always dug in leaving red marks. Now diaper changes are 100000000x easier and no red marks at all.I was also having leaking issues at night and I think because these are so stretchy they get truly get a perfect fit around my toddler and no more leaks!!!

    I've been using the Pampers Cruisers for my son once he started walking around and have always had very high praise for Pampers and their products. Noticed that Walmart had size 7s so was using those and felt so bad because the tape was starting to leave marks on my lil guy. Then I seen Amazon had the 360 version of the 7s so I thought I'd jump right on that. I literally held up a regular size 7 cruiser diaper to the 360 version and while they look physically the same size the 360 does NOT have the stretch I was expecting. I thought these were going to be so much better for my son but they suck. It takes twice as long to put it on him because I'm trying to gently ease it on him so it doesnt rip I mean once they are on they seem ok just hard to get over his thicker thighs plus no idea how it is going to be when he goes #2. Thankfully I am home all day with him and can keep an eye on him to make sure there are no blow outs.I'd like to say that I'd recommend these but if they were just a smidge stretchier Id be happy

    Le fit est bon et la flexibilité est impressionnante, elle semble très confortable à porter. Par contre, pas fait pour les bébé qui ne sont pas en apprentissage de la propreté. Difficile à enfiler a un bébé qui bouge et ma plus grande déception est le système de fermeture après l'utilisation. Bien beau rouler et mettre le petit collant, mais les selles deborde chaque côté!

    Initially I thought this would be great for my 3yr old who isn’t quite ready for potty training. Since we went for a bigger size but It leaks especially when we put on a fresh one before bedtime or even if it’s just for a nap. So I don't believe it’s absorbency is good

    We have purchased pampers cruisers for three years now and have loved them. We have never had a blow out, but now they changed the band and they fit bigger and our kid had a blowout because they are loose fitting around the legs and the chemical smell is horrible. We have always bought pampers so this change was very disappointing.

    We're using these for our toddler since a long time. Overall, we are very satisfied with the product. It fits the contours well and generally, it is hard for anything to leak but in some rare extreme cases, sometimes, a leak is not prevented. but this wouldn't stop us from continuing using this product, which makes lives of parents easier.

    I saw commercials for this but found it was hard to find in Canada, saw it was available and wanted to compare it to the pampers easy ups I’ve been using. Love the elastic at the waist very stretchy however if using this as a diaper along with potty training you lose in absorbency.

    These are great. The absorbency is great and lasts a full nights sleep. That’s all I was looking for in the diaper product and it has been successfully fulfilling my needs.

    These are nice and soft with great absorbency. My son sleeps all night with no leaks. They move with him, which is important for a busy toddler. They are easy up and down which will also be great when we start potty training. The ONLY downside is I find them slightly narrow in the bum.

    Maybe for potty training but not for normal use. My little guy is being stubborn and using them like normal diaper...they are a mess for poo. It goes up the front and back. Reminiscent of newborn days! No thank-you.

    Great soft pull up pampers - much better design than the huggies pull ups. However the pull ups are  DRENCHED in talcum powder ODOUR/SMELL. The box doesn't say that it is scented so I assumed it was unscented and was shocked at the very heavy smell of talcum powder. I wonder why the company uses this odour for their diapers - I sure hope that they are not using actual talcum powder in their diapers as it well known that talcum powder is considered unsafe to use on babies.

    If your kid has thighs or a booty, do not buy these. These are for skinny children. You with the big booty baby, just click off and don't buy them. The only way I can get these on my son who normally wears size 4 regular pampers is to rip the sides so that there's only about 1 inch left connected at the top. It ends up looking like he has a baby thong on because it keeps wedging in his bum because the sides aren't holding it out. The sides do not stretch enough and they bottom part is cut too low to fit his thighs through the holes. If your child has skinny legs and minimal bum, these probably would work for you.

    My daughter is 9 months old and she always wants to walk on all fours, so when I change her diaper, she tries to roll over. These diapers have been great because they’re faster to put on her and I can do it even if she’s upside down and trying to escape, haha. Also, they’re great for the night. They keep her dry and they look more comfy than the usual diapers with the straps.

    I’m not sure if I got a bad batch as this was the first time buying these diapers but I hate them! So for starters they pull up like pull ups, the plastic tab thing they put on he back I found useless but my main problem with these diapers is they leak horribly. My son has always used pampers baby dry which we love how ever he our grew the size 6 and he has autism so isn’t ready for potty training yet every single diaper leaked. They don’t absorb very well they are no good for over night and once they get wet they have this horrid smell that you can smell threw my sons clothes. They do have the wetness line which I do like how ever I will not be purchasing these ever again. Do not recommend
  
"
"







  
  
    We mainly bought this diaper because it is lightweight and so our son can get use to wearing pull ups. also most times, the stores don't have the size 7 and so i always stock up on here. We noticed with previous diapers in this brand,  it was leaving indentation marks on the hips. With this one, it is soft and stretchy and so it adjust to his waist and doesn't fall off. There is no risk of us tying it too tight or loose.But one thing i would say is be careful because if you have to fight your child to put his diapers on, the sides might just tear and then there is no way to fix that up. You may have to use a strong tape but then it wont be as elastic as it usually is.
  
"

    Good price point. It is scented but I leave it out and the scent either disappeared a bit or I just got use to it. Scent don’t bother us. The diapers do leave a red mark around the thigh that the other pampers pull ups don’t. I will try to size up and see if this continues. My baby is 20-22 lbs (her weight fluctuates) wearing a size 3.

    They fit my 18lb baby so well! He is such a squirmer, and getting a diaper on him is an impossible task. These ones are so much easier to put on! The waistband is so nice and fits great. And it looks 10x more comfortable than regular diaper waistbands with the straps. The only thing I don't love it how scented they are. I could smell them before I even opened the plastic sleeve. But I love everything else about this diaper, that I'll deal with the strong scent.If you have a baby that doesn't sit still, these are a must!

    If your toddler is the type who will not stay still for diaper changes this is for you. We have also tried the Huggies brand but we like this better. As other have said it is a bit narrower so you'll have to check for wedgies and make sure it's centered when put on.We used these on an overseas flight and had no problems getting our 2 year old changed standing in the on board washroom.

    They are great for potty training and I haven't had any leaks at all. I do like that they are easy to pull up and down but it makes it really hard to clean up after a bowel movement or to put zincofax on when there are no tabs to open and close. I have to rip the sides to clean, then there's no way to wrap it up neatly because the sticky tabs are gone. I also have to put it on, pull it to the side and then apply the zincofax which causes a huge mess. Decent amount of stretch to them though, you have to pull pretty hard to actually rip them
  
"

    I’ve been using these for 6 months to almost a year. Once my son hit the age where he refused to lie down to be changed these were super handy. I could change him while he stood up or even sat on my lap (as long as it was just a pee). He learned to step into them and they are one of the only brands that don’t irritate his sensitive skin. Highly recommend these. I stopped struggling with diaper changes thanks to this pull up style.
  
"
"







  
  
    I want to start by saying, we love the ease of these diapers. The pull up style with easy rip sides are a dream for changing young toddlers. In the most polite way I can say about a baby; if your babies tush is more voluptuous maybe try something else. We found our baby got wedgies often and it was hard to keep the diaper down. The rest of the fit was perfect, just made for narrow bums. We call these diapers cheeky cut diapers. As far as everything else, if you know pampers you know these. They are the same, just different fit.
  
"
"







  
  
    This is convenient for squirmy babies/toddlers. It’s also super absorbent and doesn’t leak. The downside is the scent. It’s so overly scented that it almost smells unnatural to be touching the skin. I left one diaper on my baby’s dresser for an hour and her whole room smelled like a baby powder bomb exploded in there. It’s like a whole bottle of baby powder was put into each diaper. With all the commercials we see about baby powder causing health issues and skin cancer, it makes me weary about continuing to use them. I will definitely be returning them.

    I bought these because Huggies Lil’ Movers Pull-on was out of stock everywhere (again...). My little guy likes these better. They are almost as absorbent as the Huggies (I did a commercial style comparison test), but much more absorbent than easy-ups training pants. At first I didn’t like the tear apart sides, which are like the easy-ups but they seem to be less irritating to my son and so it’s less of a fight to get these on him. They are easy to get on and off for using the potty and fit nicely around the legs and waist, very stretchy. I ended up finding some more Huggies and stocking up, but once they’re gone I’m going back to these. The only minus is that my daycare prefers the Huggies because they have adjustable tabs and can be put on and off without removing his pants entirely.

    *UPDATE: Sized down to a 6, they fit much better. Surprisingly, the narrow-ness of the diaper hasn't been an issue. No leaks so far, not even at night. They are now the preferred diapers. * I like the idea of these diapers-some independence for the little with the ""I can do it myself!"" mentality but with the ease of a diaper. Pull on, tear the sides to take off, use the tape to ""wrap it up"". And that side of things mostly works. However.... they seem to be a small make compared to the cruisers. We use a size 6 cruisers, I bought the size 7 in 360s and they are still smaller than then size 6 cruisers we usually buy. I also find them much narrower in the butt (think, sumo baby) and my kiddo is super slim. I had concerns about leaks and we are barely into the first sleeve so that's tbd. So far I know I won't be buying again, but right now it's mainly because there's no larger size.

    I have 2 kids the potty training 3YO and the now 1year only who won’t sit still. I like these diapers for overnights for my daughter they hold ALOT. Like no more wet bed in the morning from over spill/over full diaper. They hold way more than a pull-up. For my son the “you can change me if you catch me” they have been a god send because they are quick on, quick off. They also sit higher on his waist than a normal diaper so no more over the rim shots. The only downside is when we are out travelling you have to take off shoes pants then diaper instead of just pulling down the pants. At home (no shoes) we only use these diapers for how fast they are; for outings I do have the tab style in my diaper bag because getting shoes back on a squirming baby is not my style of fun..

    tried these pampers sz 7 pullup diapers instead of goodnites for a change since the price on here 'then' for the goodnites was ridiculous - and plus these you get more. they pull up easy for my son who still may wet the bed occasionally -about 48lbs and 6 yrs old. for a size comparison-they fit like a boys s/m in goodnites. he's not picky lol as long as he's not soaked by morning so it worked- however i will probably go back to good nites mainly for the 'hulk design' these have more a toddler or baby like design. but they worked for us and last a bit when your lucky that you may use 1 per night .

    I saw these come on to the market, and being the pioneers we are, we decided to try them. First off, these diapers are your standard cruisers that we all know, love and trust… but with one little quirk. No tape! And while I can see the appeal to quickly slide busy body toddlers and newly mobile infants into diapers, there are a few drawbacks to this type of diaper that makes it less desirable in some instances.- Pros -* Easy to slide onto busy body babies, no taping required.* Same absorbency and reliability of standard Pampers cruisers.- Cons -* Not easy to apply butt paste with diapers already on.* Must remove pants/shoes to put diapers on.* No tape to wrap up diaper securely, especially after a [wet] poop.- Conclusion -The thing that should make this diapers great and easy to use is also it’s Achilles heal. Since there’s no tape there’s no easy way to secure this diaper after a change, especially a wet poop… It’s messy! And also because it’s a pull up style diaper you cannot change these diapers on the go when your LOs are wearing shoes and pants. Everything comes off, so road trips, mall days or just being out, is not a treat to change em. Another challenge I have is putting on butt paste, it’s quite a hassle! you either have to stick your hand into the diaper to apply the paste after it’s on or put the paste on the baby then try sliding them into the diaper without making a mess especially on the waistband and eventually on the clothes.- Recommendation -I wouldn’t rush to buy pull up style until my kid is closer to potty training and if he no longer needs butt paste or had fairly solid poops. Until then I’ll switch back to regular good old tape style diapers. They may be a little more tedious to put on. But they do have their benefits.

    The idea of the pull up is great, but for some reason the materials used are much more irritating. My son uses a size 6 cruiser at night that he is slowly growing out of. Purchased the new pull up size 7 pair and he was so uncomfortable (itchy) that he couldn't wear it to bed. The original cruiser is much softer on the inside compared to the new pull up ones. Returning these and stocking up on the original type.

    I should have listened to the reviewer who said these diapers have a strong baby powder smell. They do! They're awful! The baby powder smell is overpowering that it's hard to know whether my baby girl has pooped. I'm donating my box of these diapers as I can't stand the baby powder smell. I wish Pampers would remove the baby powder scent as it's a decent diaper otherwise. My husband calls them the ""smelly diapers"" and said he's not putting them on our baby girl. Icup.

    With a wiggly toddler it is a perfect diaper to be able to put on. These days the kiddo also tries to put this on own. Cute colours and great stretch! I switch between these and normal diapers based on the timing. Mostly use these during the day as night efficiency might be doubtful

    I never write reviews but because Im mom now I will share my experience to help another parent. The only pro about these diapers is that it’s easy to put on your baby when he/she is moving around while changing. My son is 8 months I bought him size 4 they just fit. They don’t last through the night, once the diaper is full it leaked all up his back and in his crib. 2 hours after I put him to bed I had to change him so they definitely don’t last 12 hours. If you want to use these diapers purchase night time diapers with it because these are just day time diapers that have to be changed every hour or they start to look huge

    I wanted to live these but didn’t work for my kiddo. He is a mover and always ended up with a wedge. always seemed to flood when sitting and came nowhere near absorbent enough for over  night. He has a big pee when he wakes io in the morning and luckily we have a good soaker pad because he woke up saturated every morning. easy to put on and tear off.

    These are not a good fit. The waistband is great but the diaper itself is too large and hangs down. Does not fully cover the backside. Gave my daughter a rash from the elastic rubbing.
  
"

    Having a small child I didn’t notice the description but these are a pull up diaper. They are horrible for small kids! They are so hard to pull up and get a good fit quickly and my kid has a tendency to pee during a diaper change if it takes a while. I hate these.

    This is the only pull one I can find in smaller sizes. Great for use for littles that won't tolerate laying down to do a diaper change. The fit is equivalent to other Pampers in size 3. My little one is 22 lbs and 32 inches long and they fit great with room to grow.

    These diapers leak horribly, I have had at least one leak a day since using these on my 15 month old.  Also because they are pull ups and rip offs, if you have a mess in a diaper you have a mess everywhere when you take them off.  Do not recommend unless you are in a potty training phase, otherwise stick to swaddlers

    We put this item to our subscription three months ago. But only the first order came in as pull-up type. For the last two orders, they both came in a 360Fit box but tape diaper. Cancelled our subscription already.

    I just tried these and they are a game changer. Lately my daughter (7mth) has been squirming or crying every time I try to put her on her back for a diapar change. She is totally fine and not upset if she is in the upright position.  These just slide right on like pants, and they stay in place, easy to remove as well.

    They are supposed to be more absorbent with no leakage but they leak from sides  even with the  less pee .I think it for the thin material of sides which can be torn easily. Go for baby dry or Huggies nighttime.

    My granddaughter moves around a lot! even trying to stand on her own (still too young).  These diapers have been so appreciated.  Whatever direction she takes, the diaper follows with full protection.They stretch at the waist which means that she never has that feeling of restricted movements.  Whether she has gained a few ounces makes a difference at that age and the stretchy waistline can be adjusted.The taps are surprisingly secure and easy to work with.The best, of course, is that these diapers absorb A LOT! We change her diaper frequently during the day and have never seen any kind of rash or irritation.Love these.
  
"
"







  
  
    So these are awesome! The youngest ward in my care HATES having his diaper changed and rolls around constantly. With these, I can just pull down, quick wipe, then pull on another one while he's standing, and he doesn't think of it as changing time.  For poops, I still have to wrestle him down, but the sides tear free for tidy cleanup. To compensate for not having velcro tab to tuck it into a ball, there's a little piece of tape applied on the back that you release and use to wrap it up for disposal.Good waistband fit and they don't sag while running around. Very soft, and hold a lot of pee overnight.

    Pampers diapers are great they have been our go-to brand for our first baby and we are still figuring out what's working for our second baby but the nice thing is that they have a nice tall back on them so that helps to prevent blowouts and to keep them contained. Pampers also has stretchy legs and nice Velcro around the waist to keep it in place. The designs are simple and cute. In the largest boxes of the Pampers diapers you seem to get the best deal and I highly recommend buying them on Amazon under subscribe and save because of the additional 20% that you could save.

    Pampers cruisers 360 degree fit are the perfect diaper choice for little ones on the go. My 2 and a half year old fits perfectly in these and I love that they resemble a pull up. Its easier to use for potty training because it has no tabs, you can easily pull it up and down like regular underwear but have the peace of mind that it will absorb any pee or poops. This pack comes with 62 diapers and I think it is a great value for the money.

     These strapless diapers fit much better than expected; We didn't have any issues with leakage and the fit is perfect for our 6 month old infant. Not due to the construction of the diaper, I do find this harder to put on because our infant likes to flail his legs rapidly while getting a diaper change.As for the removal, I appreciate that the sides can be torn and diaper has a built-in tape strap on the back for rolling up. I like that these diapers do have a yellow stripe for wetness indication; They do hold quite a bit of capacity versus size 3 diapers. We chose to move from size 3 when there was accidental leakage and the diapers could not contain larger messes.With a soft construction and very stretchy sides, our infant seems comfortable in these without any issues; These diapers do have a perfume and I don't notice any irritation nor redness from our infant wearing these. Our infant is not quite at that stage where we can start potty training; However, these are a great fit for a very active baby and perhaps you don't like dealing with straps.

    We were originally using Pampers Baby Dry, and loved how well they held up overnight. These 360 Cruisers are a similar style to pull-up diapers (we already use and love Pampers Easy-ups for our toddler). The main difference I've noticed between them is that Easy-ups are sized by age, while the 360s use standard diaper sizes and are also available for infants/younger babies.I feel like you'll know if the 360s are the right diaper for your baby, based on what's already happening with their diaper. My 7 month old son is extremely active - crawling, cruising and climbing. He also loves to flip over and peace out during diaper changes. He's so active that he stretches out/bursts the elastics around his legs in standard diapers, which also gives him friction burns, and the diapers just generally look completely disheveled after he's had them on for a short time. There is also always a huge gap at the back. We could literally see my son's bum crack when he was crawling around. If he pooped, it would easily flow out of the back of the diaper if it was a lot, or if he was laid on his back.We also found the velcros on standard diapers weren't foolproof. If Grandma did a diaper change, she would never fasten the velcros tight enough for him (she's afraid of hurting him, but they need to be fastened tight!) so the diapers would be too loose and slip off his bum once he peed a few times.The 360 Cruisers solve ALL of these issues for us. We love them so far. There's no gaps, they keep up with our active son, and no guessing how tight velcros should be.I've seen some reviewers complaining about having to take baby's shoes and pants off in order to change this diaper - I didn't necessarily find that to be an issue. Probably because we're already used to using Easy-ups in our household. However, I also keep a bunch of the Baby Dry diapers at home and in our diaper bag in case I need to do a quick diaper change where taking his pants or shoes off isn't practical. I also prefer to use the Baby Dry ones at night.

    My baby not only fights nappy changes but is a constant mover even when sleeping. So when it wasn't even enough that we changed his tape diaper from size 3 to 4 for better absorbency, it was time to try these pull-ups again. I had tried these in size 3 originally but it gave my baby a rash. Now with the size 4, I'm happy to say he currently doesn't leak at night and it's a lot easier to get him into them without kicks and screams.Choosing diapers for your baby is a constant moving target due to their different needs and growth. Some trial and error will be had. But at least for my baby's current needs, these have been a great option.

    These Pampers 360 Diapers are the perfect diaper for babies and toddlers that are on-the-go but aren’t ready for Potty Training and Easy-Ups. What sets them apart from other diapers is the 360° stretchy waistband and the dual leak-guard barriers around the legs which really help to prevent leaks and keep messes contained. They also have “LockAway” channels that quickly absorb wetness to keep your baby dry and leak-free.Thanks to the tear away sides, they can easily be pulled on and off so I can easily change my busy and wiggly daughter. The wetness indicator is also one of my favourite features because I can physically see that she needs to be changed rather than having to stop her to check her diaper every so often. They also have a little piece of tape attached to the back which makes rolling it up and disposing of the diaper much easier.I appreciate that they are hypoallergenic and free from parabens, latex and elemental chlorine bleaching. They are made from natural rubber and have never given my daughter rashes or any irritation.If you are looking for a diaper that moves with your active child, is very absorbent and is super easy to put on/remove then I would give these a try. Highly recommend!

    I have a lean 1 year old who weights 21 lbs. I tried size 4 and wasn't sure if they would stay up but the top part is very long and stretchy so it fits him.  Recently, he has started to pull up the tabs of his other diapers and take them partially off. Because of this, I am so glad for Pampers Cruises 360. It is nice that they don't have any tabs for my baby to pull off. At first I thought it would be messy to remove but when I read that they have easy tear sides, they come off just like a regular diaper - I don't have to pull it down and risk getting po0p on his legs. If he doesn't have much of a mess, I will just pull them down. I also like them because they are husband-fool proof! My husband constantly has trouble with the tabs and leaves the front parts all bunched up, no matter how many times I show him how to stretch and smooth them out. So with these, there is nothing to get bunched up, he just pulls it up and they fit! I also like that they still have a wetness indicator strip.I am pleasantly surprised with how much I like these!! The only harder part is to have to shimmy them up to get them on but now that he is a year old, he likes standing up so I can pull them up the rest of the way when he stands!

    These diapers are great. When you have a baby who just doesn’t want to lay down for quick diaper changes, these are a must-have. These are pull-on style diapers but they’re better than the typical potty training diaper as they are just as absorbent as a regular diaper. The waistband is soft and comfortable. It has really food stretch to it without being saggy. I like that the sides are really easy to rip allowing for quick changes. I also think the little included tape for wrapping the used diaper is smart since there aren’t any tabs like regular diapers. The absorbency is great and bowel movements stay inside the diaper and don’t come out the leg holes or up the back. I am really happy with these diapers.

    Been buying these regularly for my 2 year old daughter. Got recommended these based on comfort, fit, and flexibility. They’re super easy to put on and have just the right amount of stretch at the waist.She’s able to move about and stay active. No diaper leaks. Scent is good as well! Will keep buying these!

    I've changed a lot of diapers in the last 4 years, with 3 little ones under 5. We've changed back and forth between some versions of Pampers or Huggies, but these take the cake.Our squirmy 12-month old is no match for the slide-on style diaper. It was nearly impossible to get a normal diaper on without her squirming away. Especially the Huggies diapers with the extra ""velcro"" strips on the side. I got so fed up. Then I saw these new 360 fit ones and will never go back.The sides tear really easily for removal, so you're not having to navigate a wet or dirty diaper off the babes and there's a pull tab sticker on the back to wrap it up before going in to the garbage/diaper genie. Highly recommend.

    We bought this due to the positive reviews that say that this diaper prevented overnight leaking. It was promising at first, for the first week it seemed the have prevented leaking, but since then, our 21 month old boy who is about 12kg (26 pounds) still seems to leak through at least half of the nights. Even double diapering didn't help with this significantly.Still overall a great diaper, as it is very soft, and seems very comfortable, but unfortunately for the purpose we bought it, did not work.

    We definitely like these diapers. They are comfy, soft and absorbent. The only thing - they may run small, my baby is 10 months old with weight 9,5 kilos now and size 4 fits her better. But they don’t last very long if the child is a heavy wetter, for us it’s 3 hours, which is quite Ok (we use reusable cloth diapers at home, these ones are for going out). I rate it as 5 stars.

    Bought these for a 7mth old that doesn't stop moving and also for overnight wear as being a boy, he would constantly pee out the side....these have pretty much remedied that problem. I usually change him in the middle of the night and these are quick on and off so he doesnt wake and I'm not fumbling in the dark with tabs and such. Also he tends to spit up with the tab diapers ehen sitting cuz they dig in but he doesn't with these. I cloth diaper alot but go to these for nights and those days where im just too tired to be doing laundry! Love them!

    I’m obsessed with Pampers 360s! They seem to scare a lot of people since they don’t have velcro sides like Pull-Ups brand diapers do. I prefer this over those! They’re also a little longer, meaning the waistband goes up higher in the front and back. This gives them more coverage for possible blowouts. They’re not an underwear-fit like some training pants are (like Hello Bello’s) but more like a diaper with an elastic waist.They’re really soft and super absorbent. If you’ve used Pampers Cruisers, they’re pretty much the same absorbency and offer the same amount of leak protection. I think they run slightly bigger than regular Cruisers or Huggies Little Movers do..... which is GREAT if you’re little one is between sizes or outgrowing 7’s in regular diapers. My son is between diaper sizes at the moment, phasing out of size 6 and into size 7. He can still get away with wearing the 360s in size 6, but can also wear these if I roll the waistband down a bit. I’m still not a fan of using these overnight, but they work in a pinch. I put my son in a night diaper like Pampers Ninjamas.The sides rip easily when it’s time to take these off. There’s a little sticky tape in the back if you wanted to roll them up and throw them away as a bundle. I never use that though....The only annoying thing is that you pretty much HAVE to take their pants off to put these on (I had become a pro at putting diapers on without taking his pants off). We started using these when my son began rolling around and standing during diaper changes. It’s so much easier to use these when standing up!I highly recommend trying them. They’re also great for potty training, because they’re easy to pull on and off. Pre-potty training, if your little one has started taking regular diapers off, these seem to be harder for them to pull down (before 18 months or so). If you need your baby to keep a diaper on these might work!As far as sizing goes, I recommend getting your kiddo’s regular size; they just may seem  a little bigger in the waist. Hope this helps! 😉

    As of mother of two little children I need to use a lot of diapers every day. I think I tried almost all diaper brands. I love and trust Pampers brand. The quality of these diapers good as always. My children's skin is not sensitive, so they never had any irritation or other problem. My child's weight is about 40 pounds and size 7 fits him well. These diapers have a higher and stretchy waistband than regular diapers. They are very absorbent. They hold liquid good, no leaking so far. Great for active toddlers and as overnight diapers. These diapers a good way to teach how to pull on/off training pants. The sides tear off easily to remove the diapers without any mess.

    Product: Pampers Diapers Pull On Cruisers 360° Fit Disposable Baby Diapers with Stretchy Waistband Enormous Pack Packaging May Vary, 70 CountNot sure of the price difference, but these are very much like potty training diapers. The only thing I find very different is that there 360s come with a small tab to keep the diaper closed when disposing (see first picture). The absorbency is great. The stretch is great. Our kiddos actually don't need a size 7 just yet but there is no dashing or leaking despite it being too large at this point. Absorbency is what you'd expect with pampers-it can make it through the night no problems. Nice product.

    This 70 pack of size 7 cruisers/ pullups comes in two packs of 35 each.The diapers are rated for 41lbs+ (19kg+).They fit my 49 pound  5 year old great. Not too loose and not tight.The sides are solid fused so they can't come apart while pulling up or down.The absorbent padding doesn't go all the way up the front or back- it gets to within 3 inches of the top of the front and 4 inches from the top of the back. I've had issues with similar diapers that leaked overnight from not enough coverage there and although I haven't had any leaks yet I feel it might happen with these.They have that powder fresh pamper scent.

    This is perfect for overnight protection, they fit so nicely and very soft and comfortable almost like an underwear fit. Biggest thing that stands out with this vs other popular brands that it doesn’t have Velcro on the size that often would irritate skin and make it itch. It’s very stretchy so it would really fit any toddler. As far as absorbency it does do a good job holding on accident but I’m not using it as a diaper, mostly only for “just in case”, as we pretty much done with potty training. I love pampers and always trust it thru all stages with my little ones!

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers size 7 work great for the mobile baby.  Actually, more like big kid since this is (or should be) a potty training diaper.  Good stretch, especially when kiddo decides to pull on them while ""helping"".  Adequate leak protection and absorption, even overnight.  And I didn't notice skin pinching or  irritation.  The sides also tear easily for throwing away.  No hangups.  I've never had an issue with Pampers.  I like you get such a big box in this size.  That's new to me.

    My 9 month old is going through the phase of hating diaper changes so she does everything in her power to roll and crawl away. we tried EVERY brand of diaper in the world. From the very expensive to the least expensive. Invariably, our son would over fill those diapers! Far too many mornings he would wake up very happy and very wet. Now, he's 13 months and it's been fortunate he learned to sleep for 10-11 hours nightly very early on. But we couldn't find a diaper that could stay dry.

    I love these diapers! They are super soft on my toddler's skin and absorb everything. They don't leak. I love how these are super stretch, because my baby is a mover! They don't rip or fall off. Pampers price point is always awesome for the amount and quality. I love the fun designs. These are amazing compared to other diaper brands!

    I ordered more of these so that we can work on nighttime potty training. These go on like underwear but absorb like a diaper. My toddler is daytime potty trained but doesn’t wake at night on her own.I like that they pull up and down easily. I can go to  wake her up in the night to take a quick trip to the toilet and get her back to bed without adjusting diaper straps. She says they’re comfortable. And in the morning they rip off easily.

    Like other pamper diapers, my kids never have had problems with them.  These work well for my growing and moving boy with those stretchy sides.  The easy to pull sides and tape that is included is a nice little added bonus for securing and tossing everything away. Most importantly no issues with leaking or bulky sides that allows things to escape.  The diapers are easy to pull up (and down to remove.)

    We have always found Pampers to be great diapers with nice feeling material and nice fit, and these are no exception.Just keep in mind that diaper fit is super subjective; one of our kids always used Pampers, one we used Huggies.So, while I recommend these, you might want to try out a variety of diaper options and see what works best for your kiddo.

    This family has used Pampers Cruisers a few years back for one girl in the family.  Although they’re always trying to improve, I don’t see how they can.  Everyone is a fan of different types of diapers for different reasons.  No two babies are alike and comparing Pampers to Huggies is like comparing apples to oranges so I’m not going to talk about the two, but rather just about these Pampers Cruisers.  For example, some babies are taller than others and sometimes one diaper that will work for one toddler won’t work for another.Sometimes even generics work, but I chose to use cloth diapers and then at a later stage, Pampers.  We chose to use the during the night because they were extra absorbent and had a snug fit.  Not that anyone cares, but I do love the different graphics Pampers comes out with.  Of course, I like the dryness and fit factor even more.These Pampers Cruisers are just for the child they say they are and, in this case, for 41 pounds and up.  The toddler or young child who is really starting to move around.  There have been a lot of improvements in the past couple of years, especially in managing to keep things in when there is a blowout.  One other thing is that the leakage protection is great not only for overnight, but also when you are in the on-the-go mode.

    These diapers are so cute (pattern) and they do a great job. We rarely, if ever, have any accidents with these Pampers.Some pros about these diapers:- cute designs- indicates which side is for “back”, saving me time trying to figure it out- slip on, rip off design- stretchy banded waist, movable with active babies- pee indicator (SO important)- sticky tab to help seal and contain dirty diapers- soft and absorbentCons:- just wish these were biodegradable and not so bad for landfills, but that’s my wish for ALL diapersBottom line:These pretty much check all the boxes of the things I look for in a diaper. Baby’s happy, mommy and daddy’s happy!

    Comparing these to Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants - these seem to be able to absorb more, have much softer sides and have a more baby-like design (as opposed to toddler design). The tear sides to remove work as well as in Easy Ups Training Pants but these also have a disposal tape that helps you compress this into the bin and minimize smell and mess by keeping the excrement inside after throwing out.I think the different designs and patterns are really sweet and minimalist without in-your-face movie characters etc.The quality I learned to expect from Pampers is always on point, these are no different. We did not experience blowouts or premature rips that would make you throw away a perfectly clean diaper.Size 7 is quite big, if size 6 is not big enough for your needs than it is a great option.These are for your child if you find the value better than other pull up offers from Pampers or other brands, it is certainly high quality. The soft and flexible sides are a real plus.

    I got these for my 3rd child who is 3 years old. Maybe I’m losing it, but I could have sworn with my other 2 kids the pampers cruisers were just regular diapers, not pull ups. It’s also my fault for not really looking into the description since I just assumed they would be just regular pamper cruisers. But to be fair they don’t really advertise it on the box or make it very clear. Of course I am still using them, there just not what I expected.The pull-up itself is exactly what I have come to expect from pampers, soft and comfortable on my child, and good leak protection. They are also movement friendly and have the perfect amount of stretch in both the legs and stomach. I guess the new thing about these is the tape that makes it easier to wrap and throw away since it doesn’t have adjustable sides like regular diapers for wrapping. I’ve got to admit this does come in handy though! Overall I’m happy with these! Just make sure your aware that these are pull-up style, not regular diapers!

    My five-year-old grandson has been potty trained for years, but still has nighttime accidents a couple of times a week. We had tried various pee pads, ""waterproof"" mattress covers, and nighttime diapers, but I would always have to wash all of his bedding, and his mattress. We have always used Pampers on our babies, and once again they did not disappoint. He has stopped having large accidents since we got these, but he has had several smaller accidents and these have been great. He can put them on himself, unlike a diaper, but they fit like a diaper. They also have the Pampers wetness indicator, which is great because if he wakes up dry I know we can use the diaper another night. Another plus is that you can take it off and roll it up like a diaper and secure it with the little tape strip- very helpful for messy diapers. Wish I had bought these years ago and saved myself a ton of laundry and stress.

    I figured I would try these for our son since we are in the process of potty training and figured these would be easier to use. I will say I loved how roomy the size 7 was with him being 3 and 25lbs these fit him perfectly. I think the only thing that was difficult about these is that for example our son can take his diaper to the garbage to throw away these when you tear the sizes to change him have a little tape at the back that helps to roll it closed but the sizes are still open so depending on how messy of a diaper were talking about here these weren't convenient in a sense that a diaper you can seal it up all the way sides and all. The other thing is these left behind pieces of the pamper which were extremely difficult to fully get off of him in between changes. In all these wouldn't be something we would look at buying or choosing again in the future.

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 is amazing when you have a toddler on the moved, your tot can just step right into these. I wouldn’t suggest these for the younger crowd though. I remember trying these way back when for my higher percentile child and they didn’t work for her then, we did have leaks. They work great for us now though.The waist band is stretchy and cozy for my little gal, she even said she likes it! You just rip the sides when you’re done and roll it up and there’s a tap tab and then that is all. It’s as simple as that. As I said this is idea for that tot who is on the go, my gal is definitely on the go and she is so excited stepping, well jumping into these. We’ve had no issues, I can see these forming to all different body types too. I definitely suggest these.

    Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360° Fit Disposable Baby Diapers are perfect for daytime use for kids who are ready to potty train. They do on as underwear and have a stretchy waistband and fused-together sides, so can go up and down multiple times if needed. The design is unisex and would work for both boys and girls. There is a wetness indicator strip so you (or your kid) can get a visual clue that the diaper needs to be changed.I would recommend using them during daytime and switching to a more absorbent overnight diaper before bedtime becase the absorbent pad doesn't go all the way to the waistband on the back and in our experience with similar diapers it may cause leaks at night. I haven't tried them at night for this reason, but they work great during the day.

    I got these Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 fit for my daughter who currently hates wearing regular diapers. She wants to wear a diaper like wearing a pant, which she doesn't need to lay down when changing diapers. This is her first time trying out 360 fit pull on diapers and she loves them a lot! These diapers are soft and comfortable to wear. The waist band is stretchy but tight enough to prevent leaks. I let her wear these pull on in the day time when she is able to tell me when she's ready to go potty. I also like how sweet it is to include a secure tape, so you can roll up then tape the used diaper before throwing into trash can! Overall, I am 100% satisfied with this product and will continue to use it! Highly recommend!

    I recently ordered a box of Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants and I love them.  But there are 2 aspects of the Easy Ups that I don't like.  First, there is no wetness indicator.  The only way to know if it's time to change them is to pull them down and take a look.  Second, you can't easily tell which side is the front and which side is the back.  Well, I am happy to say that these Pampers Pull On Cruisers 360 Diapers fix both of those problems!  Plus they do just as good of a job at keeping my son dry as the Easy Ups do.  So in the future I will probably buy these diapers instead.  These Cruisers are great for potty training.  My son loves them because they are so comfortable and easy to pull down when he needs to.

    These pampers 360 Pull Ups are great for toddlers in the throws of potty training. They fit true to size, are very similar to ""big kid"" undies, and hold a great amount of liquid when needed. They do a great job of containing any accidents, especially if your child is up moving around, it easily wicks moisture away from the skin, and is overall a great training diaper.

    Love pampers so when we needed this size went to these.  I would say these are like other pamper cruisers. They absorb well and fit true to size.  They look like underwear which is important to potty training. My son wears them with no issues.  The overnight absorbency is okay but would not give my kid a lot of water before bed.  Overall very satisfied.

    Pampers are my go to brand. Yes, they’re pricier than most nappy (diaper) brands but you pay for quality! The gap free guarantee is brilliant! They keep my 2 year old from leaking & I love the handy line/ indicator and design of the nappies. They’re soft & as my son is a large 2 year old, I’m glad that they go up to a size 7. Potty training just got easier!

    As always with Pampers, these diapers are great quality! If properly place, you won't have leaking problems (at least God thanks I haven't had any). Reliable during day and night, when my girl is active and while she's resting. I find this to be at a fair price point for the quality of the products and you'll get them delivered to your door with no delays :)

    These toddler pull-on type diapers are great. They pull up and down like underwear for potty training. But you can rip the sides easily to take them off. There is even a little tape in the back so if you want to roll up the dirty diaper and secure it in a ball, you can do so, like a diaper. They smell like baby powder which I love. Pampers never disappoints!

    My wife and I love using Pampers because they’ve always worked well for us and our baby. These diapers are true to size for the recommended size and weight that they’re supposed to be. We’re glad these are reliable to use at any moment and are super helpful for potty training stage! Its 360 fit feature is very useful :)

    These Diapers are one of the best, the 360 is amazing. . I have a 2 year old whos over 40lbs and refuses to wear underwear all the time so when he wont we use this and its great. This boy is all over the place and were never had a leak yet! we've also used this for car rides and it holds a great deal of fluid.

    Honest review here.We love these and they have a great absorbency and stretch.  Will re order.Love that there are no gaps and the liquid does not come out of the diaper.  They  are a great fit and very easy to tear and fold up.I can recommend.

    These diapers are great.  They've caused no irritation on the skin.  They are perfect for potty training.  They absorb well and prevent leaks.  I highly recommend.

    The only thing I don't like is the scent, the rest is good. Thin and breathable, easy to put on and take off.

    Why does pampers make so many scented diapers- and why isn’t it made clearer that they are. I was excited to upgrade to a pull- up style because my lo hates laying down on the table to have it done. I found that they were easy to pull on and off though still reds to lay down to wipe bottom. Unfortunately I don’t like to use unnatural scents especially in delicate areas so I tried one and now I want to return the whole box. I read the whole box and cannot find where it advertises that it is scented. I wouldn’t have bought these had I known but perhaps other won’t mind.

    It's very absorbent, fits comfortably, and isn't scratchy. It is the best fitting diaper we have ever found. It is the one diaper that won't leave rub marks on her skin too. No matter ehat size or brand, the others would make rub marks. These have made such a positive difference that I am willing to spend more to order them from offline than purchase any other diaper available from our store down the street.

    Perfect fit for my 7 month old. Switched to the 360 when he started pulling on the tapes of traditional diapers. This is more convenient and also comfortable for the baby as he gets more active and mobile. Goes all night without any leaks.

    I used to worry I was pulling the other diapers tape too tight. No worries with these. Works well during the day but he generally smells like pee and his clothes is a little damp by morning. That sucks. But other than that these work wonderful.

    All of the diapers automatically rip down the seams the second I put it on my toddler. I am furious

    I love these diapers! My baby always tries running away as soon it’s time for a diaper change but with these I can easily pull them up! Waiting until my baby can walk to start potty training. I most likely will stick with these.

    For the life of me I couldn’t get my baby to stay still for a diaper change. He still wiggles when i put these on but I don’t have to worry about getting the sticky strips in the right place.

    A very good price over what I expect to pay at the grocery store for the big box of Pampers. Quality is what you would expect from this brand, order now!

    The pampers diapers 360 are the best! They don’t leave red lines and hold a lot. Sometimes I think they work better than pull ups.
