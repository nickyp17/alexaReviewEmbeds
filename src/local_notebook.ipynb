      "    Been a fan of Anker charging cables for many years now.  So when I wanted to pick up a new power bank I was happy to find Anker made those too.Overall I’m fairly happy with the item.  In my initial test of the product, I’ve been using it exclusively over the past few days to charge my iPhone XS Max.  Prior to each charge I’ve taken the phone’s battery down to around 1%-5%, so essentially dead.  Here is what I found:1.  This thing charges an iPhone fast...like lickety split!  It gets my phone up to about 70% in an hour with a full charge to 100% taking about an additional half hour.  Very nice.2.  I get nearly four full charges of my phone from a fully charged power bank.  The fourth and final charge only gets me to about 85% so not a full charge...but pretty close.3.  Takes about 11 hours to charge the power bank itself.I was hoping to be able to squeeze out five charges from this thing but perhaps that was unreasonable on my part.  I don’t have much experience with power banks so don’t really have a frame of reference to work from.  Four charges is decent and, for my purposes, will fulfill my needs nicely.  Add in the 18-month warranty and a company that will back it, well that’s icing on the cake.  I would recommend this product.* Helpful votes always appreciated *\n",

I charged my phone with it 1.5 times until the battery depleted — it charged my phone much faster than my older power banks did, and I was impressed!The issue was charging the power bank itself; it wouldn’t. I had it plugged in for over 24 hours and the first bar was still blinking. I used a different wall adapter and plugged it in for another 24 hours, same thing. I ended up returning the product. I was really disappointed as Anker is supposed to be a good brand.It was likely defective as my friend who has the exact same power bank says it’s been good to her. I could’ve contacted customer support or something to get it replaced, but I didn’t truly need another power bank right now so I didn’t care to. By the time I decide to buy again, maybe Anker will have a newer model.\n",

      "    A wonderful 20,000 Mah power bank. I believe it has 18W which allows faster and more convenient charging. The product came in a well packaged and safe box with no obvious signs of damage. When you get to the actual power bank box, there is a nice flap on the plastic connecting the top to the side which allows for easy opening. The product comes with a user manual, a short micro usb cable, a cover for the power bank, and of course, the power bank itself. The power bank is heavier then I assumed but I quickly got used to the feeling of it. However, I still wouldn't put it in my pocket, it feels unnatural and awkward but it does work well in a backpack, or briefcase. And for anyone wondering, all of the ports on the power bank are far enough away to be used at once.\n",

I think I will have this one for a long time, I am glad I spent the money a reliable brand because I have gone through many lower quality ones and they have all given out or have terrible battery life. I could charge 2 iPhone 11s simultaneously and we were able to get more than one full charge out of it. It's pretty sturdy and a little heavy (I carried it in my small purse some days and I quickly realized I much preferred to have a tote or a bigger bag to carry it around).The only \"dislike\" (if you can call it that) I have is how long it takes to recharge the charger, but I guess with such good power it makes sense! If you charge it overnight it will be fully charged by morning.\n",

I figured people were being dramatic and an Anker would be much better but I was wrong... kind of.The battery bank was empty so I set it to charge, using the USB-C plug, and I went to work. When I came home it was still charging between 50-75%  (about 10 hours later). When I set it to charge with the microUSB it seems to charge much faster (in about 6 hours or so).Overall I do recommend this product as it holds its charge well and is a nicely built product but be prepared to wait while it charges and maybe stick to the microUSB to charge when on the go.\n",

      "    I purchased this specifically to elongate the battery life of my Quest 2, and it works wonders! With a full charge, you can easily keep the Quest going all day.For wireless PCVR gaming via airlink/virtual desktop, more power is used and the device will typically not CHARGE, but will retain its battery level so that you can still play. With less intensive games onboard the Quest, the battery will actually charge while you're playing.This has 4x the capacity of the bobo vr elite battery strap, and almost 7x the capacity of the oculus elite battery strap.I personally mounted this to the back of my official elite strap with three strips of velcro and it actually increases the comfort of the strap (for me) by offsetting some of the front-heaviness of the Quest. My son does claims however that it is heavy and uncomfortable, but just runs it in his pocket instead and works like a charm.If you find yourself constantly disappointed  with a dead headset and tired of having to wait to play, do yourself a favour and grab this powerbank!\n",

The build quality and included holder are nice though, just wish I had gotten the right model.Update: Anker customer service offered to send a replacement. My main disappointment was the fact that it doesn't support fast charging. I was sent the exact same model that doesn't support fast charging, while I appreciate the extra power bank, it serves me no additional use but nevertheless, thank you I guess?Besides that, this Powerbank definitely lasts. Great build quality as expected from Anker.\n",

My charger that came with my phone only has USB-C connectors at both ends, so this wasn't very convenient. Thankfully I had another charger with a USB connector on one end so that I could use this device, but if you don't then you will need to buy another charger cable with a USB connector on one end or this device is useless.\n",

Only had it for a short time and tested it with a Samsung phone and Amazon Fire tablet.I was disappointed that it won't \"fast charge\" my phone as the description said it supported the Power IQ protocol. It also takes a really long time to charge the battery of the PowerCore even with a Power IQ charger. I tried different USB cables that will fast charge with my phone and other devices and had the same slow charge result and the device is not in trickle charge mode.  Maybe this is something Anker should be more up front about in the item description. Maybe it's a problem with the unit I received, I will check to see how the other one works and update my review if it performs better.Not super satisfied but if you are okay with slow charging this device might be okay for you.\n",

      "    I got a new phone in October and the battery is... **poop** I'm constantly plugged into the wall, it's a pain in the butt and makes going out really hard.  so I went on the hunt for a power bank because not everywhere you go you're allowed to plug in. I hummed and hawwed  over which brand and then which version, I settled on this one because it has the option for lower power item charging for things like headphones. I didn't want to write a review until I had tested the powerbank out, it's a life saver. I was able to fully charge my Samsung s20fe four and a half times before it ran out of power. Things I will point out (all of which I already knew from reading the description), It takes a very long time for it to charge it's self (over 10hrs) which makes sense because it's storing alot of juice. The powerbank has some weight to it which is fine for me but it might not be for everyone if you're used to a light purse.  one thing i did notice is that the wall plug (the one that came with my samsung) It gets really hot when its charging so i only charge the power bank in the open and in a room where i can keep an eye on it (to be clear the wall plug which is NOT Anker gets hot). I wonder if an Anker brand would stay cool. It is a slow charge with the anker or Samsung cord when charging my phone, honestly doesn't really bother me much because i'm used to a slowcharge when plugging in without the full samsung manufacturers charging set up (eye roll). I'm currently testing the hold on the charge, it's been just over two weeks and still shows four dots, so time will tell. the one thing i haven't tested is the slow charge.This powerbank as a whole is a 10/10 from me.\n",

      "    It's a 2.5 Amp Charger at 5V so it looks like it charges at 12 watts. My phone doesn't recognize it as 'fast charging' which requires 15W, but it's not trickle charging either (5W)  but I didn't buy it for my phone - I bought it for my Quest 2 to keep playing VR through the day. For that, it's fantastic. It provides a backup to the battery - I'm pretty sure the Q2 runs at 15 watts so when using this battery unless there's a large difference in charge between this battery and the Q2 native battery you'll not see it as charging - the Quest 2 will just simply last much much much longer.  I've never run this out but my play sessions rarely exceed 5 straight hours of VR, which is kinda enough.  It does charge fairly slowly and took ALL NIGHT to charge first time, which is probably because it's like 4-5x the size of a standard phone battery.\n",

      "    This battery pack only charges my s9 plus 3 times before running out of charge. When it says it will fo it more than 5 times. The battery bank takes over a day to fully charge by samsung fast charger. I like Anker product but this one is not up to the expectations. It also quite slow interms of charging the phone as well.Update: I initially rated this 2 star and because of Anker's amazing customer service I rating it 4 star. They send me another unit and it turns out the new unit is very good. I can charge my s9 plus 5 to 6 times before the battery runs out of juice. It still takes a while to fully charge. With my 15W charger takes approximately 15 hours. I m overall happy with the product.\n",

      "    This charged my phone to 77% (Google pixel 2 XL) and my friend's phone to about 40% (iPhone 8) and it still had four lights on (which means it was still above 75% power). I never go anywhere without it.just a tip; if you have devices with different types of chargers I recommend getting a multi cord instead of carrying around 3 cables I have a Google pixel 2 XL which uses a USB C, Airpods which use a lightning adapter, and my Bluetooth speaker which uses a micro USB and having one cable that can charge all three is super convenient I can just throw the battery pack and one charger in my pocket and not have to worry*EDIT* I just thought I would update this, I bought this back in the beginning of January and it's now the beginning of September, this thing has been dropped and abused and beaten up and it's still working just like the day I bought it.\n",

      "    There is no clear indication anywhere on this product's page indicating the charge time. I see 15 watt maximum but they do not specify under what circumstances as I know I get nowhere near that. I have another Anker battery pack that has 18W charging labelled on it and that charges fast. This product charges at 5W based on the time difference between charging with this product and the other 18W anker battery pack. I have tried different wires thinking the issue was with the USB wire but I use those on the other anker product and they charge at 18W whereas with this product I am getting 5W. This is a misrepresentation if this product actually charges at 5W and it is not faulty. When it takes my phone almost 4 hours to charge from 40%, what is even the point of using this battery pack? Horrible product!\n",

      "    UPDATE: Anker contacted me to assist me with this issue. They were able to explain a feature of this power bank that was NOT in the instructions. You have to press the power-check button twice to get a green light (along with the blue lights) and then it is put into trickle charging mode. THEN it will fully charge small units like my blue tooth head set. I must admit that this feature is a little annoying as I now have to remember to press the button when charging my headset. (My original Anker power bank did not have this feature and charged my headset just fine). Now my power bank appears to be working just fine. Also I give Anker a thumbs up for their customer service.  They were prompt in contacting me to sort out this issue and very responsive.This power bank does not seem to be able to fully charge my small bluetooth headset. It should be able to charge the bluetooth headset to seven hours of talk time and it simply won't do it.  I am not sure if something is wrong with this new power bank but I am currently not satisfied with it!  I also do not like that it is difficult to see the blue charging lights because they are too small.\n",

I especially liked the little card they included saying \"Happy? Not Happy?\"It looks like you'd expect a battery like this to look. Four USB ports on the bottom: Two Type-A ports for charging your phone or laptop, and a USB Type-C & Micro USB port for charging the battery itself. I don't have specifics, but it can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 (a few years old, I admit) from <10% to 100% in no time.I expect to be able to use it for a year to come, perhaps more, and doubt it'll give me any problems. Very well made, and comes with its own little mesh carry pouch. Comes with a little instruction booklet and a USB-A to Micro USB cord. Instructions are pretty simple: Plug it into the wall, let it charge to full, then plug your phone into it. Also there's a mode with a green light which looks to be no different to normal operating mode.In conclusion, 10/10 would recommend to fren.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n",

      "    Très bonne batterie de secours, très puissante et endurante. Très nombreuses recharges de divers appareils (cellulaire, tablettes, casques audio, liseuses) et je n'ai pas réussi à la mettre à plat. Ralenti un peu quand on recharge 2 appareils en même temps (environ 30% plus de temps) Si je cumule grossièrement les charges que j'ai fait, je pense être capable de recharger au moins 5 à 6 fois mon S9 en le branchant à 20% de reste de batterie. Un peu lourde pour le transport dans une poche, parfait pour un sac à dos ou une sacoche. Grosse comme un cellulaire XL pour environ 2 fois l'épaisseur, ce qui vous donne une idée. Livrée avec un petit filet très pratique pour éviter les scratchs mais sans doute peu efficace en cas de chute. Malgré tout cette batterie me semble de bonne conception et le plastique à l'air solide. Prévoir une nuit pour la recharger complètement, la puissance a un prix...Très satisfait de cet achat.\n",

    "        'Review: You\\'d think if you advertised a USB-C charged power bank that you could at least include a usb-c charging cable. included micro USB is just a cheap-out at this point. . capacity\\'s fine, functionality is fine, build quality... feels a little less than i expected of Anker.\\nReview: Went to charge it again and it wouldn’t charge. I attempted multiple outlets, charging wires, and chargers but it wouldn’t charge. Reached out to customer service and they claim that I am a week out of the warranty and they are unable to help me. I loved anker but I won’t be returning as a customer.\\nReview: I got this charger for Christmas. It wasn\\'t charging very fast (almost like a tickle charge). I did some research and I found using the USBC cable had it completely charged in a matter of hours. I get 8 charges on a full battery for my phone. A family member had her own pocket juice but kept \\\"\\\"stealing\\\"\\\" this one, as it charged her phone quickly and could get more uses out of the Anker. I purchased one for her as well and she loves it. The only draw back is it does not come with a usbc cable.\\n\\nTLDR: The general consensus is that that the device has charging issues.\\n--\\nReview: Very flimsy material and runs about 2 sizes SMALL.\\nReview: It’s paper thin and zero cotton . Horrible material\\nReview: Wasn’t sure how heavy the cloth would be, it turned out to be thinner and lighter but with enough body to be comfortable. Colors are good for a print.\\n\\nTLDR: The general consensus is the material is cheap, but the design printed well.\\n--\\n'\n",
